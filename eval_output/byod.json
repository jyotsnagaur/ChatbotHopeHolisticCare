Restrictions on authorized use Employees whose personal devices have camera, video or recording capability are restricted from using those functions anywhere in the client\u2019s home or office or on company property at any time unless authorized in advance by management. While at work, employees are expected to exercise the same discretion in using their personal devices as is expected for the use of company devices.

The policy sets the following restrictions: Unauthorized Recording Prohibited: You are not allowed to use your personal device's camera, video, or recording capabilities on company property, including the client\u2019s home or office, unless you have received specific authorization in advance from management. This restriction aims to protect the privacy and confidentiality of clients and to maintain the integrity of sensitive company information. Protection of Privacy: The key reason for these restrictions is to prevent the unauthorized capturing of images, videos, or recordings that could potentially violate the privacy of clients or compromise confidential company data. Before you use your device's recording functions in any capacity for work-related purposes, you must seek and receive explicit permission from your management. This ensures that all recording is conducted in compliance with company policies, legal requirements, and ethical standards. Whenever you are unclear about what is or isn't allowed, it's always best to consult with your supervisor or the IT department. They can provide clarification on the policy and the proper procedures applying to recording on company property or in any work-related setting. Compliance with these guidelines is critical to safeguarding the privacy and rights of all parties involved and for protecting the company's information security."
