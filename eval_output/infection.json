Healthcare Associated Infections (HAIs) are a major cause of poor patient outcomes, and a significant proportion of infections can be prevented if infection control practices are developed, implemented and adhered to. This Infection Control Policy will seek to minimise the risk of infection for: \u2022 Persons receiving services \u2022 Persons employed or engaged by HHC Hope Holistic Care will adhere to the following principles in relation to infection prevention and control: \u2022 Infection control will be a component of Hope Holistic Care\u2019s overall risk management framework \u2022 Hope Holistic Care will include organisation-wide involvement in all aspects of this Policy \u2022 Hope Holistic Care will make infection prevention and control an item on clinical governance committees Procedures Preparing Staff Hope Holistic Care will ensure that staff members: \u2022 Receive training and supervision related to infection prevention and control procedures; \u2022 Can identify and assess infection control risks; \u2022 Plan and prepare for identified risks, including communication to clients or staff; \u2022 Always act with caution and use protective barriers or personal protective equipment; \u2022 Understand the importance of hand care and hand washing; \u2022 Follow procedures regarding the use of needles and sharp objects; and \u2022 Review each client-related incident that involves actual or potential risk from passing on infections, and use this to inform policy and practice in the future. Responsibilities: Hope Holistic Care will: \u2022 Establish local governance systems for Infection Prevention and Control; \u2022 Ensure Infection Control Policies are implemented. Hope Holistic Care\u2019s Managers will: \u2022 Ensure the necessary tools and resources are provided to Infection prevention and control worker training for them to be able to implement Hope Holistic Care\u2019s Infection Control Infection Prevention and Control Policy _POL_V01_2209 1|Page Infection Prevention and Control Policy management policy; \u2022 Conduct surveillance and audit programs to monitor key infection rates and process measures; and \u2022 Identify risks that apply through surveillance data and implement strategies to mitigate such risks. Hope Holistic Care\u2019s Infection prevention and control coordinators will: \u2022 Develop an infection management plan in line with national and state guidelines to minimise the occurrence and impact of Healthcare associated Infections (HAI); \u2022 Ensure adequately trained workers are responsible for the surveillance of hand hygiene compliance data; \u2022 Contribute to the formulation of consensus practice guidelines; and \u2022 Ensure education and training on infection control and prevention is provided to all workers as part of induction. Hope Holistic Care\u2019s Healthcare facility workers: \u2022 Understand the requirements of infection prevention and control; \u2022 Adhere to state and local policies and procedures on infection control at all times; and \u2022 Undergo the required training and competency assessment in infection prevention and control procedures. Reporting A surveillance and monitoring system will be established and implemented in accordance with [insert relevant state legislation]. Monitoring may include both outcome measures and/or process measures. Such measures may include: \u2022 Hand hygiene; \u2022 Indwelling device insertion; \u2022 Antiseptic technique; \u2022 Antimicrobial stewardship; \u2022 Application of standard and transmission based on precaution; and \u2022 Cleaning \u2013 appropriate level to the level of service.

Examples of breaches of infection control procedures include, but are not limited to: \u2022 Antiseptic technique procedure not followed; \u2022 Correct Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) not worn; \u2022 Sharp safety procedures not followed; and Infection Prevention and Control Policy _POL_V01_2209 2|Page Infection Prevention and Control Policy Risk Management Hope Holistic Care will ensure there is cooperation between management, healthcare workers and care workers in the risk management framework for controlling HAI. The risk management framework for HAI should include; \u2022 The identification of patients/situations that are presenting an infection transmission risk to other patients and/or workers; \u2022 Patients or workers members who are at increased risk of acquiring infection in the healthcare setting. Measures to prevent and control infection: Hope Holistic Care will take a two-tiered approach to implementing work practices to prevent and control infection. This will include both standard precautions and transmission-based precautions.
