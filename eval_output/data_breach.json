Hope Holistic Care will act appropriately and in a timely manner in the event of a data breach, to contain the possible resulting harm and notify individuals affected as required. Definitions Data Breach: When personal information held by an organisation is disclosed accidentally, lost, or accessed without permission. This can be as a result of human error, or through malicious action by an employee or an external party. Examples include where a secure IT system containing personal information has been hacked, a storage device being lost by an employee, or an employee accidentally releasing personal information to the wrong person. Personal information: \u2018Information about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable: whether the information or opinion is true or not; and whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not.\u2019 (Privacy Act 1988, Section 6) Procedure Identify When staff have reason to believe there has been a data breach, they should inform the Office immediately. At this time, details such as when and how the breach was discovered, and by whom, should be recorded. This will be recorded in the incident register. Contain As soon as a breach or suspected breach has been identified, any steps to contain or limit the potential harm should be taken. This may include shutting down a system that has been breached, or recovering any records. The CEO will complete a preliminary assessment of the breach and take any immediate action to contain the breach if possible. Assess If the preliminary assessment finds that further investigation and assessment is necessary to understand the nature and extent of the breach, it will be escalated to the data breach response team. The team will work together to gather information, assess risks and the likelihood of serious harm from the breach, and therefore whether it is an \u2018eligible\u2019 (notifiable) breach. To evaluate whether a known data breach is notifiable, consider the following three questions: \u2022 Has there been unauthorised access, unauthorised disclosure, accidental loss, or theft of personal information that the organisation holds? Data Breach Response Plan _POL_V01_2305 1|Page Data breach response plan For example, the organisation\u2019s database is hacked, a portable storage device containing personal information is lost, or the organisation accidentally releases personal information to the wrong person. \u2022 Is it likely that this may result in serious harm to individual/s whose data has been breached? This can include but is not limited to psychological, financial, emotional, physical or reputational harm. To be able to accurately assess the likelihood and seriousness of harm, it requires looking at the context of the data and how it may have been breached. For information about the factors to consider when deciding whether harm is likely and/or serious, refer to section 26WG of the Privacy Amendment (Notifiable Data Breaches) Act 2017 \u2022 Does the likelihood of serious harm remain despite taking available remedial action? The obligation to notify the OAIC can be avoided if the organisation takes remedial action in a timely manner to prevent the risk of harm occurring, either by making the harm unlikely to occur, or non-serious. If the answer to the above three questions is yes, then the breach classifies as an eligible data breach and organisations are required to notify the OAIC and any affected individuals. If there are reasonable grounds to suspect that there has been a data breach, the data response team should conduct an assessment of the suspected breach. The assessment of a suspected breach must take place within 30 days of it occurring, and should seek to find out the likelihood of serious harm occurring as a result of the suspected breach. If it is assessed to be likely, this has the same notification obligations as a known data breach under the NDB Scheme. Take remedial action Remedial action can be taken at any point throughout the data breach response process \u2013 the sooner the better. However, it may be that the full extent and nature of the breach, and therefore the actions that could be taken, are not known until after assessing and investigating the breach. Examples of remedial action include remotely deleting sensitive information from a laptop which has been lost, or emailing affected individuals with advice to change their password details for an online account for which login information may have been hacked. The data breach response team should document the process of any remedial action, making sure to document rationale and reasoning as to why a certain conclusion has been made. If, after the remedial action has been taken, the risk of harm is reduced so that it is unlikely to occur, or non-serious, then there is no requirement to notify. Even if there is no requirement, however, the data response team should consider whether to contact affected individuals with advice for further protecting their information as a customer service measure. Notify Once a breach has been assessed as eligible, relevant individuals and bodies should be notified as soon as practicable. Notification must include the following information as a minimum: Data Breach Response Plan _POL_V01_2305 2|Page Data breach response plan \u2022 The organisation\u2019s name and contact details \u2022 Description of the data breach \u2022 Type of information involved in the breach \u2022 Advice and recommendations for individuals to take in response 1. The OAIC The CEO is responsible for notifying and liaising with the OAIC for data breaches which have been assessed as eligible for the purposes of the Notifiable Data Breaches Scheme, using the OAIC\u2019s Notifiable Data Breach form. 2. Notification of individuals who are at likely risk of serious harm due to the data breach The way notification occurs will depend on the context and nature of the breach, and the relationship of the individuals affected to the organisation. It should occur as soon as practicable after completing the notification statement for the OAIC. Individuals may be contacted by phone and email. A public notification may also occur. Notification to affected individuals may contain an explanation of what happened to their personal information, an apology, description of what measures have been put in place as a result of the breach, and advice on what they can do to further protect their information. Record and review Data breach log A data breach log will record all instances of data breaches or suspected breaches, as well as document assessments of the breach and any changes made as a result of a breach. All staff should be made aware of the log, and the CEO will be responsible for ensuring that all breaches or suspected breaches are recorded accurately in the log. Review Whether or not the breach or suspected breach was notifiable, a review should be conducted into processes relating to the breach to strengthen protections in the future. Depending on the type and seriousness of the breach, this may include: \u2022 A full investigation into how the breach occurred \u2022 Implement measures to ensure it does not reoccur, documented in a prevention plan \u2022 Reviews of security, cybersecurity and ICT policies and procedures \u2022 Audit of implementation of relevant policies and procedures \u2022 Additional staff training about privacy and data breach responses Data Breach Response Plan _POL_V01_2305 3|Page",

Only discuss the breach with those who are directly involved in handling it, such as your supervisor, the appointed investigator, or the CEO. Cooperate with the Investigation: If an investigation is undertaken, provide any information you have and cooperate fully with the investigators. Remember, confidentiality is a cornerstone of care services, and any breach could have serious repercussions for clients and the organization. The policies at Hope Holistic Care are designed to protect client information and upholding these standards is everyone's responsibility.

Hope Holistic Care will act appropriately and in a timely manner in the event of a data breach, to contain the possible resulting harm and notify individuals affected as required. Definitions Data Breach: When personal information held by an organisation is disclosed accidentally, lost, or accessed without permission. This can be as a result of human error, or through malicious action by an employee or an external party. Examples include where a secure IT system containing personal information has been hacked, a storage device being lost by an employee, or an employee accidentally releasing personal information to the wrong person. Personal information: \u2018Information about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable: whether the information or opinion is true or not; and whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not.\u2019 (Privacy Act 1988, Section 6) Procedure Identify When staff have reason to believe there has been a data breach, they should inform the Office immediately. At this time, details such as when and how the breach was discovered, and by whom, should be recorded. This will be recorded in the incident register. Contain As soon as a breach or suspected breach has been identified, any steps to contain or limit the potential harm should be taken. This may include shutting down a system that has been breached, or recovering any records. The CEO will complete a preliminary assessment of the breach and take any immediate action to contain the breach if possible. Assess If the preliminary assessment finds that further investigation and assessment is necessary to understand the nature and extent of the breach, it will be escalated to the data breach response team. The team will work together to gather information, assess risks and the likelihood of serious harm from the breach, and therefore whether it is an \u2018eligible\u2019 (notifiable) breach. To evaluate whether a known data breach is notifiable, consider the following three questions: \u2022 Has there been unauthorised access, unauthorised disclosure, accidental loss, or theft of personal information that the organisation holds? Data Breach Response Plan _POL_V01_2305 1|Page Data breach response plan For example, the organisation\u2019s database is hacked, a portable storage device containing personal information is lost, or the organisation accidentally releases personal information to the wrong person. \u2022 Is it likely that this may result in serious harm to individual/s whose data has been breached? This can include but is not limited to psychological, financial, emotional, physical or reputational harm. To be able to accurately assess the likelihood and seriousness of harm, it requires looking at the context of the data and how it may have been breached. For information about the factors to consider when deciding whether harm is likely and/or serious, refer to section 26WG of the Privacy Amendment (Notifiable Data Breaches) Act 2017 \u2022 Does the likelihood of serious harm remain despite taking available remedial action? The obligation to notify the OAIC can be avoided if the organisation takes remedial action in a timely manner to prevent the risk of harm occurring, either by making the harm unlikely to occur, or non-serious. If the answer to the above three questions is yes, then the breach classifies as an eligible data breach and organisations are required to notify the OAIC and any affected individuals. If there are reasonable grounds to suspect that there has been a data breach, the data response team should conduct an assessment of the suspected breach. The assessment of a suspected breach must take place within 30 days of it occurring, and should seek to find out the likelihood of serious harm occurring as a result of the suspected breach. If it is assessed to be likely, this has the same notification obligations as a known data breach under the NDB Scheme. Take remedial action Remedial action can be taken at any point throughout the data breach response process \u2013 the sooner the better. However, it may be that the full extent and nature of the breach, and therefore the actions that could be taken, are not known until after assessing and investigating the breach. Examples of remedial action include remotely deleting sensitive information from a laptop which has been lost, or emailing affected individuals with advice to change their password details for an online account for which login information may have been hacked. The data breach response team should document the process of any remedial action, making sure to document rationale and reasoning as to why a certain conclusion has been made. If, after the remedial action has been taken, the risk of harm is reduced so that it is unlikely to occur, or non-serious, then there is no requirement to notify. Even if there is no requirement, however, the data response team should consider whether to contact affected individuals with advice for further protecting their information as a customer service measure. Notify Once a breach has been assessed as eligible, relevant individuals and bodies should be notified as soon as practicable. Notification must include the following information as a minimum: Data Breach Response Plan _POL_V01_2305 2|Page Data breach response plan \u2022 The organisation\u2019s name and contact details \u2022 Description of the data breach \u2022 Type of information involved in the breach \u2022 Advice and recommendations for individuals to take in response 1. The OAIC The CEO is responsible for notifying and liaising with the OAIC for data breaches which have been assessed as eligible for the purposes of the Notifiable Data Breaches Scheme, using the OAIC\u2019s Notifiable Data Breach form. 2. Notification of individuals who are at likely risk of serious harm due to the data breach The way notification occurs will depend on the context and nature of the breach, and the relationship of the individuals affected to the organisation. It should occur as soon as practicable after completing the notification statement for the OAIC. Individuals may be contacted by phone and email. A public notification may also occur. Notification to affected individuals may contain an explanation of what happened to their personal information, an apology, description of what measures have been put in place as a result of the breach, and advice on what they can do to further protect their information. Record and review Data breach log A data breach log will record all instances of data breaches or suspected breaches, as well as document assessments of the breach and any changes made as a result of a breach. All staff should be made aware of the log, and the CEO will be responsible for ensuring that all breaches or suspected breaches are recorded accurately in the log. Review Whether or not the breach or suspected breach was notifiable, a review should be conducted into processes relating to the breach to strengthen protections in the future. Depending on the type and seriousness of the breach, this may include: \u2022 A full investigation into how the breach occurred \u2022 Implement measures to ensure it does not reoccur, documented in a prevention plan \u2022 Reviews of security, cybersecurity and ICT policies and procedures \u2022 Audit of implementation of relevant policies and procedures \u2022 Additional staff training about privacy and data breach responses Data Breach Response Plan _POL_V01_2305 3|Page",

For example, a system hack, loss of a storage device containing personal information, or accidental release of information to the wrong individual. Risk of Serious Harm: Is it likely this may result in serious harm to individuals whose data has been breached? Serious harm can include psychological, financial, emotional, physical, or reputational damage. The context of the data and how it may have been breached are important for accurately assessing the likelihood and seriousness of harm. Effectiveness of Remedial Action: Does the likelihood of serious harm remain despite taking available remedial action? An obligation to notify may be avoided if the organization takes remedial action promptly to prevent the risk of harm from occurring, either by making the harm unlikely to occur or by rendering it non-serious. If the answer to these questions is yes, then the breach classifies as an eligible (notifiable) data breach, and organizations are required to notify the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) and any affected individuals . It is essential to conduct an assessment of the suspected breach within 30 days of its occurrence to determine the likelihood of serious harm. If the risk of serious harm is likely, the organization has the same notification obligations as known data breaches under the Notifiable Data Breaches (NDB) scheme .
