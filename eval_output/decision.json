Hope Holistic Care understands and affirms that cognitive impairment is not a reason for a person to be excluded from the decision-making process about their own life. Hope Holistic Care understands that not all decisions require assistance and will support clients primarily when they make significant decisions which have immediate or long-term consequences regarding their health, finances or lifestyle. Hope Holistic Care is committed to supporting clients with complex care and communication needs to make their own decisions regarding their life. The will and preferences of a client will only be overridden if a decision is deemed by staff or advocates to be dangerous to the wellbeing of the client or others. Definitions Decision is a planned course of action, either short or long term, regarding the lifestyle, healthcare or financial affairs of an individual. Dignity of risk is the recognition that every individual should be able to do something that has a level of risk involved, whether real or perceived. Financial Decisions include but are not limited to: \u2022 Investment decisions; \u2022 Sale or gifts of property or valuable possessions; \u2022 Use of money. Functional Capacity Assessment is an assessment of an individual\u2019s decision-making capacity in the present moment. The assessment should focus on the person\u2019s understanding of the decision, its context and consequences, and should not contain a judgement on whether a person\u2019s decision is wise or unwise. Healthcare Decisions include but are not limited to: \u2022 Seeking or obtaining a diagnosis; Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy _POL_V01_2209 1|Page Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy \u2022 Accessing (or refusing) care services; \u2022 Responding to crisis (falls, incidents); \u2022 Agreeing or refusing medical treatment; \u2022 Advance care planning. Lifestyle Decisions include but are not limited to: \u2022 Living arrangements; \u2022 Relationships; \u2022 Employment; \u2022 Civic participation; \u2022 Holidays and outings; \u2022 Pets and possessions. Representative is a person or organisation that assists the client in the decision-making process and, where necessary, makes decisions on behalf of the client. A Representative is designated by a client, or by appointment from another body if the client is unfit to nominate a Representative, and includes a Substitute Decision Maker. Substitute Decision Maker (guardian) is a legally appointed person such as a guardian to make decisions on behalf of a client in certain areas, for example Healthcare Decisions and Lifestyle Decisions, or a financial manager to make Financial Decisions. A Substitute Decision Maker should work with a client\u2019s informal support networks to support a client to build their decision-making capacity. Substituted Judgement is a decision made by a Representative regarding a client who is unable to communicate their will and preferences, or when a client\u2019s will and preferences infringe on their rights or the rights of others. A Substituted Judgement is based on the client\u2019s previous expressed will and preferences or, if this is unknown, a Representative\u2019s interpretation of \u2018what the client would have wanted\u2019. Supporter is a person or organisation who is designated by the client or organisation to aid in the communication and development of the client\u2019s wishes regarding their care. Supporters may be required to aid in the decision-making process, however the ultimate decision-making power lies with the client. Procedures Choice Information strategies Information in appropriate formats about the opportunities for client choice will be provided to clients at each major service point from intake to end of service. If clients have literacy or communication issues, then every effort should be made to ensure they understand their rights and opportunities in making decisions regarding services. The information is available in the following documents: \u2022 Consultation about HHC services \u2022 Care planning process Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy _POL_V01_2209 2|Page Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy \u2022 Review of Care Plan \u2022 Annual Survey \u2022 Advance care planning \u2022 Complaints Support to make choices Clients will have the opportunity to make choices about their service in the following ways: \u2022 service delivery access - types of service available, the days and times a service can be accessed, frequency of attendance, the location, how the service is provided to ensure that it meets individual needs (particularly in terms of physical, cultural or communication needs) \u2022 individual service planning - expressing preferences for the level or intensity of service, which other services are involved, the ways that personal goals will be achieved, how progress reviews are conducted, and decisions about changes or exiting the service Hope Holistic Care actively supports service users to make choices in the way they use services: \u2022 follow-up on written information and specific assistance to clients who may experience cultural or language barriers, or who may need specialised advocacy or support to take full advantage of the opportunities, providing information in a range of mediums: written, pictorial, verbal. Record keeping Hope Holistic Care documents all input from clients regarding their service preferences. This is recorded on the client\u2019s file. Supported Decision making and Dignity of Risk Clients will be provided with access to the support necessary for them to make, communicate and participate in decisions regarding their life and care. Clients should be provided with a Chinese format of this policy and be supported to understand it. Staff will receive information and training on the nature of capacity in decision-making and how to support client decision-making that upholds clients\u2019 rights. Designating the role of Supporters and Representatives Supporters and Representatives should be designated by or with the consent of the client, and their roles can be formalised into a written decision-making agreement. To avoid conflicts of interest, Supporters and Representatives should preferably not be in a position where they have interests in Hope Holistic Care or any other service provider delivering services to the client, as this may compromise their role. Where this is unavoidable, the written supported decision-making agreement should include a declaration of any conflicts of interest if they exist, and specify how actual or potential conflicts will be managed. Supported decision-making should occur in collaboration with informal support networks such as friends, family, peer support and independent advocates. This will help to create a natural safeguard for the client and prevent Supporters from making decisions which are not in the client\u2019s best interests. Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy _POL_V01_2209 3|Page Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy Assessing client decision-making capacity Care workers will notify the Case Manager if there are concerns regarding a client\u2019s decision-making capacity. The Case Manager will assess the situation and discuss with the client and their carer/representative regarding decision making support processes. Suggestions may be made to refer the client to relevant and qualified assessors (e.g. Solicitor, GP, social worker etc) for an assessment to be made to determine the client\u2019s decision-making capacity. Substituted Judgement If it is determined that the client is unfit to make a decision regarding their life, their will and preferences will be overridden, and a Substituted Judgement will be made by the authorised Representative. This is considered as a last resort. Clients will only receive a Substituted Judgement or have their will and preferences overridden if: \u2022 They cannot understand any of the risks associated with their decisions; or \u2022 The proposed decision presents a threat to the wellbeing of the client or others. Supporting decision-making The current or previously expressed will and preferences of the client will be respected and carried out unless they are unlawful, or compromise other rights such as their right to safety, or the rights of others. In the process of supporting a client\u2019s decision: 1. A client\u2019s will and preference should be respected and given effect; If will and preference are not known: 2. The Representative(s) must make a decision on what the client would likely want, based on the information available; If it is not possible to determine what the client would likely want: 3. The Representative must act to preserve the client\u2019s human rights and make the least restrictive decisions regarding those rights. Where clients require assistance in the communication of their will and preference, the organisation will provide the appropriate tools and strategies for the client to express themselves. This may include use of pictures, assistive technology or language services. Staff will support and assist clients to understand the context and consequences of their decisions. Staff will work proactively with clients to establish social histories, life-story work and care plans as documentation which might assist in future decision-making scenarios. Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy _POL_V01_2209 4|Page Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy Dignity of risk Supporters will respect an individual\u2019s right to the dignity of risk and will not dissuade them from making a decision based on the associated risks alone, whether real or perceived. If a client\u2019s decision involves some level of risk, Supporters should ensure that the client can foresee and understand the risks associated with the decision. Staff will attempt to manage the risks associated with significant decisions, while not attempting to change the client\u2019s mind regarding a decision. Process for dealing with perceived conflict of interest If a staff member or person from a client\u2019s support network believes a Representative or Supporter is not acting in the best interests of a client, they are to notify the Home Care Manager as soon as possible. Following a complaint in relation to an assisted decision, the Home Care Manager will assess whether the Representative or Supporter\u2019s vested interest in the decision influenced their actions. If it is found that the Supporter or Representative had a vested interest in a decision and the decision made was not in the best interests of the client, they will be removed as a Supporter or Representative. If required, matters involving the abuse of Representative decision-making may be referred to the Guardianship tribunal or the Police or a relevant external body, depending on the situation. Documentation For Substituted Judgements that may have significant immediate and long-term consequences, the decision-making process and outcome will be documented and will be stored in the client\u2019s case file.

            "Empowering clients to make choices about their care, including choices that involve personal risk, is an important aspect of supporting their autonomy and dignity. The Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy [Decision_Making_Choice_and_Dignity_of_Risk_POL_V01_2208] provides guidance on this matter: Respect Client's Rights: Acknowledge and support the human right of clients to make decisions about their own life and have these decisions respected, recognizing that cognitive impairment is not an automatic exclusion from the decision-making process. Supported Decision-Making: When clients are making significant decisions with immediate or long-term consequences, give them support, primarily concerning their health, finances, or lifestyle. For clients with complex care and communication needs, provide support to help them make their own decisions regarding their life. Dignity of Risk: Respect the individual's right to dignity of risk. Staff should not dissuade clients from making a decision based solely on associated risks, whether real or perceived. Ensure that clients understand the risks involved in their decisions. Document Preferences: Keep records of client preferences regarding their service and use these as a basis for supporting the decision-making process. Communication Tools: If clients need assistance communicating their preferences, provide appropriate tools and strategies, such as pictures, assistive technology, or language services. Educate Staff: Staff should receive information and training on supporting client decision-making in a way that upholds their rights. Avoid Overprotection: Balance the exercise of duty of care with the principle of respecting clients' rights to make their own choices, including those involving personal risk, and help clients build self-reliance while ensuring their safety. Conflict of Interest: If there's a perceived conflict of interest, it must be managed appropriately, ensuring that the client's best interests are always the primary concern\u30100\u2020policy.json\u2020file-96qq8m41DnQwRSDjyLotuSoL\u3011. In every case, it's important to ensure that the client is fully informed and supported to make an autonomous decision, and to document these decisions and the support provided. When risks are involved, there should be a careful and respectful consideration of these risks, ensuring the client understands them and that their choices are respected as much as possible without compromising their safety or the rights of others. If there's ever uncertainty about how to proceed, it's advisable to seek advice from management or colleagues familiar with the policy and the principles it upholds."

Hope Holistic Care understands and affirms that cognitive impairment is not a reason for a person to be excluded from the decision-making process about their own life. Hope Holistic Care understands that not all decisions require assistance and will support clients primarily when they make significant decisions which have immediate or long-term consequences regarding their health, finances or lifestyle. Hope Holistic Care is committed to supporting clients with complex care and communication needs to make their own decisions regarding their life. The will and preferences of a client will only be overridden if a decision is deemed by staff or advocates to be dangerous to the wellbeing of the client or others. Definitions Decision is a planned course of action, either short or long term, regarding the lifestyle, healthcare or financial affairs of an individual. Dignity of risk is the recognition that every individual should be able to do something that has a level of risk involved, whether real or perceived. Financial Decisions include but are not limited to: \u2022 Investment decisions; \u2022 Sale or gifts of property or valuable possessions; \u2022 Use of money. Functional Capacity Assessment is an assessment of an individual\u2019s decision-making capacity in the present moment. The assessment should focus on the person\u2019s understanding of the decision, its context and consequences, and should not contain a judgement on whether a person\u2019s decision is wise or unwise.

Representative is a person or organisation that assists the client in the decision-making process and, where necessary, makes decisions on behalf of the client. A Representative is designated by a client, or by appointment from another body if the client is unfit to nominate a Representative, and includes a Substitute Decision Maker. Substitute Decision Maker (guardian) is a legally appointed person such as a guardian to make decisions on behalf of a client in certain areas, for example Healthcare Decisions and Lifestyle Decisions, or a financial manager to make Financial Decisions. A Substitute Decision Maker should work with a client\u2019s informal support networks to support a client to build their decision-making capacity. Substituted Judgement is a decision made by a Representative regarding a client who is unable to communicate their will and preferences, or when a client\u2019s will and preferences infringe on their rights or the rights of others. A Substituted Judgement is based on the client\u2019s previous expressed will and preferences or, if this is unknown, a Representative\u2019s interpretation of \u2018what the client would have wanted\u2019.

Procedures Choice Information strategies Information in appropriate formats about the opportunities for client choice will be provided to clients at each major service point from intake to end of service.

Supported Decision making and Dignity of Risk Clients will be provided with access to the support necessary for them to make, communicate and participate in decisions regarding their life and care. Clients should be provided with a Chinese format of this policy and be supported to understand it. Staff will receive information and training on the nature of capacity in decision-making and how to support client decision-making that upholds clients\u2019 rights. Designating the role of Supporters and Representatives Supporters and Representatives should be designated by or with the consent of the client, and their roles can be formalised into a written decision-making agreement. To avoid conflicts of interest, Supporters and Representatives should preferably not be in a position where they have interests in Hope Holistic Care or any other service provider delivering services to the client, as this may compromise their role. Where this is unavoidable, the written supported decision-making agreement should include a declaration of any conflicts of interest if they exist, and specify how actual or potential conflicts will be managed. Supported decision-making should occur in collaboration with informal support networks such as friends, family, peer support and independent advocates. This will help to create a natural safeguard for the client and prevent Supporters from making decisions which are not in the client\u2019s best interests. Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy _POL_V01_2209 3|Page Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy Assessing client decision-making capacity Care workers will notify the Case Manager if there are concerns regarding a client\u2019s decision-making capacity. The Case Manager will assess the situation and discuss with the client and their carer/representative regarding decision making support processes. Suggestions may be made to refer the client to relevant and qualified assessors (e.g. Solicitor, GP, social worker etc) for an assessment to be made to determine the client\u2019s decision-making capacity. Substituted Judgement If it is determined that the client is unfit to make a decision regarding their life, their will and preferences will be overridden, and a Substituted Judgement will be made by the authorised Representative. This is considered as a last resort. Clients will only receive a Substituted Judgement or have their will and preferences overridden if: \u2022 They cannot understand any of the risks associated with their decisions; or \u2022 The proposed decision presents a threat to the wellbeing of the client or others. Supporting decision-making The current or previously expressed will and preferences of the client will be respected and carried out unless they are unlawful, or compromise other rights such as their right to safety, or the rights of others. In the process of supporting a client\u2019s decision: 1. A client\u2019s will and preference should be respected and given effect; If will and preference are not known: 2. The Representative(s) must make a decision on what the client would likely want, based on the information available; If it is not possible to determine what the client would likely want: 3. The Representative must act to preserve the client\u2019s human rights and make the least restrictive decisions regarding those rights. Where clients require assistance in the communication of their will and preference, the organisation will provide the appropriate tools and strategies for the client to express themselves. This may include use of pictures, assistive technology or language services. Staff will support and assist clients to understand the context and consequences of their decisions. Staff will work proactively with clients to establish social histories, life-story work and care plans as documentation which might assist in future decision-making scenarios. Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy _POL_V01_2209 4|Page Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy Dignity of risk Supporters will respect an individual\u2019s right to the dignity of risk and will not dissuade them from making a decision based on the associated risks alone, whether real or perceived. If a client\u2019s decision involves some level of risk, Supporters should ensure that the client can foresee and understand the risks associated with the decision. Staff will attempt to manage the risks associated with significant decisions, while not attempting to change the client\u2019s mind regarding a decision. Process for dealing with perceived conflict of interest If a staff member or person from a client\u2019s support network believes a Representative or Supporter is not acting in the best interests of a client, they are to notify the Home Care Manager as soon as possible. Following a complaint in relation to an assisted decision, the Home Care Manager will assess whether the Representative or Supporter\u2019s vested interest in the decision influenced their actions. If it is found that the Supporter or Representative had a vested interest in a decision and the decision made was not in the best interests of the client, they will be removed as a Supporter or Representative. If required, matters involving the abuse of Representative decision-making may be referred to the Guardianship tribunal or the Police or a relevant external body, depending on the situation. Documentation For Substituted Judgements that may have significant immediate and long-term consequences, the decision-making process and outcome will be documented and will be stored in the client\u2019s case file.

            "When you encounter a client who is overwhelmed by a significant decision-making process, you should provide support and assistance based on their individual needs, while respecting their autonomy and independence. Here are the guidelines from Hope Holistic Care\u2019s policies: Support and Respect Autonomy: Support the client in making their own informed choices and respect their right to participate actively in decisions about their life. Make sure to understand that cognitive impairment is not a reason to exclude a person from the decision-making process\u30100\u2020Decision_Making_Choice_and_Dignity_of_Risk_Policy\u3011. Offer Information: Ensure the client has access to information in a format they understand. This could include translating policy information into the client\u2019s language, using pictures or other assistive tools to aid comprehension, and providing detailed explanations of choices available to them at various service points, from intake to service end\u30102\u2020Decision_Making_Choice_and_Dignity_of_Risk_Policy\u3011. Assess Decision-Making Capacity: If there are concerns regarding the client's decision-making capacity, the Case Manager should assess the situation and discuss it with the client and their carer/representative. If necessary, suggestions may be made to refer the client to relevant and qualified assessors for a formal capacity assessment\u30104\u2020Decision_Making_Choice_and_Dignity_of_Risk_Policy\u3011. Recognize Dignity of Risk: Acknowledge the client's right to dignity of risk which means allowing them the freedom to make choices that involve risk. Do not attempt to change the client's mind based on perceived risks alone; instead, ensure they understand the potential consequences of their decisions\u30105\u2020Decision_Making_Choice_and_Dignity_of_Risk_Policy\u3011. Use of Supporters: If a client requires assistance, designate a Supporter to aid in the development of the client's wishes regarding their care. The ultimate decision-making power should remain with the client\u30102\u2020Decision_Making_Choice_and_Dignity_of_Risk_Policy\u3011.

Following a complaint in relation to an assisted decision, the Home Care Manager will assess whether the Representative or Supporter\u2019s vested interest in the decision influenced their actions. If it is found that the Supporter or Representative had a vested interest in a decision and the decision made was not in the best interests of the client, they will be removed as a Supporter or Representative. If required, matters involving the abuse of Representative decision-making may be referred to the Guardianship tribunal or the Police or a relevant external body, depending on the situation. Documentation For Substituted Judgements that may have significant immediate and long-term consequences, the decision-making process and outcome will be documented and will be stored in the client\u2019s case file.

            "When managing the risks associated with a client's choice to take a risk, it is essential to ensure that the client is well-informed about the risks involved and to support their decision-making process.

For clients with complex care needs, assist them in making their own decisions about their life\u30105\u2020Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy\u3011. Dignity of Risk: Respect an individual\u2019s right to the dignity of risk. Do not dissuade them from making a decision based solely on the associated risks, whether real or perceived. Instead, ensure the client understands the risks associated\u30107\u2020Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy\u3011.

Timely Review: Home Care Managers and Registered Nurses must timely review completed care plans to ensure accurate parameters to mitigate risks, and these care plans must be approved to optimize client safety and well-being\u30103\u2020High Impact High Prevalence Risks Policy\u3011.

These steps allow for a balanced approach that accommodates the client's autonomy while managing their safety and the safety of others."

Hope Holistic Care understands and affirms that cognitive impairment is not a reason for a person to be excluded from the decision-making process about their own life. Hope Holistic Care understands that not all decisions require assistance and will support clients primarily when they make significant decisions which have immediate or long-term consequences regarding their health, finances or lifestyle. Hope Holistic Care is committed to supporting clients with complex care and communication needs to make their own decisions regarding their life. The will and preferences of a client will only be overridden if a decision is deemed by staff or advocates to be dangerous to the wellbeing of the client or others. Definitions Decision is a planned course of action, either short or long term, regarding the lifestyle, healthcare or financial affairs of an individual. Dignity of risk is the recognition that every individual should be able to do something that has a level of risk involved, whether real or perceived. Financial Decisions include but are not limited to: \u2022 Investment decisions; \u2022 Sale or gifts of property or valuable possessions; \u2022 Use of money. Functional Capacity Assessment is an assessment of an individual\u2019s decision-making capacity in the present moment. The assessment should focus on the person\u2019s understanding of the decision, its context and consequences, and should not contain a judgement on whether a person\u2019s decision is wise or unwise. Healthcare Decisions include but are not limited to: \u2022 Seeking or obtaining a diagnosis; Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy _POL_V01_2209 1|Page Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy \u2022 Accessing (or refusing) care services; \u2022 Responding to crisis (falls, incidents); \u2022 Agreeing or refusing medical treatment; \u2022 Advance care planning. Lifestyle Decisions include but are not limited to: \u2022 Living arrangements; \u2022 Relationships; \u2022 Employment; \u2022 Civic participation; \u2022 Holidays and outings; \u2022 Pets and possessions. Representative is a person or organisation that assists the client in the decision-making process and, where necessary, makes decisions on behalf of the client. A Representative is designated by a client, or by appointment from another body if the client is unfit to nominate a Representative, and includes a Substitute Decision Maker. Substitute Decision Maker (guardian) is a legally appointed person such as a guardian to make decisions on behalf of a client in certain areas, for example Healthcare Decisions and Lifestyle Decisions, or a financial manager to make Financial Decisions. A Substitute Decision Maker should work with a client\u2019s informal support networks to support a client to build their decision-making capacity. Substituted Judgement is a decision made by a Representative regarding a client who is unable to communicate their will and preferences, or when a client\u2019s will and preferences infringe on their rights or the rights of others. A Substituted Judgement is based on the client\u2019s previous expressed will and preferences or, if this is unknown, a Representative\u2019s interpretation of \u2018what the client would have wanted\u2019. Supporter is a person or organisation who is designated by the client or organisation to aid in the communication and development of the client\u2019s wishes regarding their care. Supporters may be required to aid in the decision-making process, however the ultimate decision-making power lies with the client. Procedures Choice Information strategies Information in appropriate formats about the opportunities for client choice will be provided to clients at each major service point from intake to end of service. If clients have literacy or communication issues, then every effort should be made to ensure they understand their rights and opportunities in making decisions regarding services. The information is available in the following documents: \u2022 Consultation about HHC services \u2022 Care planning process Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy _POL_V01_2209 2|Page Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy \u2022 Review of Care Plan \u2022 Annual Survey \u2022 Advance care planning \u2022 Complaints Support to make choices Clients will have the opportunity to make choices about their service in the following ways: \u2022 service delivery access - types of service available, the days and times a service can be accessed, frequency of attendance, the location, how the service is provided to ensure that it meets individual needs (particularly in terms of physical, cultural or communication needs) \u2022 individual service planning - expressing preferences for the level or intensity of service, which other services are involved, the ways that personal goals will be achieved, how progress reviews are conducted, and decisions about changes or exiting the service Hope Holistic Care actively supports service users to make choices in the way they use services: \u2022 follow-up on written information and specific assistance to clients who may experience cultural or language barriers, or who may need specialised advocacy or support to take full advantage of the opportunities, providing information in a range of mediums: written, pictorial, verbal. Record keeping Hope Holistic Care documents all input from clients regarding their service preferences. This is recorded on the client\u2019s file. Supported Decision making and Dignity of Risk Clients will be provided with access to the support necessary for them to make, communicate and participate in decisions regarding their life and care. Clients should be provided with a Chinese format of this policy and be supported to understand it. Staff will receive information and training on the nature of capacity in decision-making and how to support client decision-making that upholds clients\u2019 rights. Designating the role of Supporters and Representatives Supporters and Representatives should be designated by or with the consent of the client, and their roles can be formalised into a written decision-making agreement. To avoid conflicts of interest, Supporters and Representatives should preferably not be in a position where they have interests in Hope Holistic Care or any other service provider delivering services to the client, as this may compromise their role. Where this is unavoidable, the written supported decision-making agreement should include a declaration of any conflicts of interest if they exist, and specify how actual or potential conflicts will be managed. Supported decision-making should occur in collaboration with informal support networks such as friends, family, peer support and independent advocates. This will help to create a natural safeguard for the client and prevent Supporters from making decisions which are not in the client\u2019s best interests. Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy _POL_V01_2209 3|Page Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy Assessing client decision-making capacity Care workers will notify the Case Manager if there are concerns regarding a client\u2019s decision-making capacity. The Case Manager will assess the situation and discuss with the client and their carer/representative regarding decision making support processes. Suggestions may be made to refer the client to relevant and qualified assessors (e.g. Solicitor, GP, social worker etc) for an assessment to be made to determine the client\u2019s decision-making capacity. Substituted Judgement If it is determined that the client is unfit to make a decision regarding their life, their will and preferences will be overridden, and a Substituted Judgement will be made by the authorised Representative. This is considered as a last resort. Clients will only receive a Substituted Judgement or have their will and preferences overridden if: \u2022 They cannot understand any of the risks associated with their decisions; or \u2022 The proposed decision presents a threat to the wellbeing of the client or others. Supporting decision-making The current or previously expressed will and preferences of the client will be respected and carried out unless they are unlawful, or compromise other rights such as their right to safety, or the rights of others. In the process of supporting a client\u2019s decision: 1. A client\u2019s will and preference should be respected and given effect; If will and preference are not known: 2. The Representative(s) must make a decision on what the client would likely want, based on the information available; If it is not possible to determine what the client would likely want: 3. The Representative must act to preserve the client\u2019s human rights and make the least restrictive decisions regarding those rights. Where clients require assistance in the communication of their will and preference, the organisation will provide the appropriate tools and strategies for the client to express themselves. This may include use of pictures, assistive technology or language services. Staff will support and assist clients to understand the context and consequences of their decisions. Staff will work proactively with clients to establish social histories, life-story work and care plans as documentation which might assist in future decision-making scenarios. Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy _POL_V01_2209 4|Page Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy Dignity of risk Supporters will respect an individual\u2019s right to the dignity of risk and will not dissuade them from making a decision based on the associated risks alone, whether real or perceived.
