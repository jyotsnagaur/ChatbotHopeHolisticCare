Explain why their behavior is not acceptable or why a decision is unfair . Lodging a Formal Complaint: If a discussion does not resolve the issue, or it is too sensitive for an informal process, notify your immediate manager about the substance of the grievance in writing. If it's not appropriate to notify your manager, notify the next level up or the CEO directly . Investigation and Reporting: An unbiased person experienced in dealing with grievance matters will investigate the grievance in a fair, objective, and timely manner. All relevant parties will be informed about the investigation . Impartiality: The investigator handling the complaint must remain impartial and not favor any party or make presuppositions about the matter before the investigation is complete.

Sometimes people behave inappropriately without realising, or make decisions without considering the repercussions. Telling the person will give them the chance to stop or change what they are doing. The following steps should be followed for this step: a) If you have a grievance at work, do not ignore the problem. b) Speak to the person who you believe to be the cause of the grievance, explaining how you feel as soon as practicable after the problem has arisen. If the grievance is about their behaviour, tell them that it is not acceptable, it is offensive, unsuitable or hurtful. If it is about a work decision, tell them why you think it is unfair, inappropriate etc. c) Keep a diary note of the date and content of the discussion and if there were any witnesses present d) If the behaviour persists or if no agreement can be achieved, you are able to lodge a formal complaint as outlined below Should adopting an informal approach to resolving a grievance prove unsuccessful, or the matter is highly sensitive and not appropriate for an informal process, the following steps give guidance for managing a formal grievance: a) Notification- (making a complaint) You must notify, in writing or otherwise, the substance of the grievance and attempt to resolve it with your immediate Manager. The CEO may become involved depending on the situation. If the grievance is of a nature that you cannot notify your immediate Manager because it is not appropriate, you may notify the next reporting level up. For particularly difficult or sensitive grievances, where referral up to the next level is neither the appropriate or preferred avenue, you may refer the matter, in writing to, direct to the CEO. b) Investigation and reporting The grievance is investigated. Relevant material and information are sought, including information from other sources where appropriate. Documentation is complied. the length and formality of communication about the grievance will depend on the seriousness and complexity of the complaint, but should generally at this stage be minimal. Communication to those involved, should include Grievance Management Procedure_PRO_V01_2201 3|Page Grievance Management Procedure suggested actions/options to resolve the grievance or to provide guidance for referring the matter to the next level up or to the CEO as appropriate.
