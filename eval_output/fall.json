It is particularly common for older Australians living in aged care facilities to experience falls. Hope Holistic Care (HHC) is committed to taking necessary measures to prevent falls and fall-related harm from occurring in our facilities. We will ensure appropriate falls assessment, prevention and management strategies are effectively implemented. We will also ensure that workers are adequately trained on how to assess, identify and mitigate falls. Definitions Syncope (fainting): is a temporary loss of consciousness, often related to insufficient blood flow to the brain. Most commonly occurring when blood pressure is too low, and the heart doesn\u2019t pump enough oxygen to the brain. Polypharmacy: is the concurrent use of multiple medications by a patient. Vestibular dysfunction: is a common cause of dizziness among the older population. Continence: is the ability of a person to control bowel and bladder movements. Procedures Risk Screening and Assessment HHC will conduct a screening and assessment of all clients in our facilities upon arrival and every six months. This falls risk screening process will be undertaken by a Registered Nurse and will include the following assessment from the best practice guidelines, to determine if the resident is a high or low falls risk. After determining the risk category of each client, an individualised management plan will be developed by Registered staff which outlines the main falls risks and mitigations strategies. The management plan will be used so that all staff are aware of the risks posed to each individual client, and any additional environmental or medical strategies which may need to be implemented. Syncope (fainting) All clients will be assessed for syncope on arrival at the facility. Presyncope, syncope and postural hypotension will be included when developing the client\u2019s management plan for falls prevention. The root causes of clients who report having unexplained falls or episodes will be identified and addressed. Dizziness and vertigo Clients will be assessed for vestibular dysfunction if they experience dizziness, vertigo or imbalance. Vestibular rehabilitation will be implemented to treat dizziness and balance problems where indicated. Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 1|Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy Vision Clients will receive an eye examination on arrival to determine if they have cataracts. Clients who have severe visual impairments will receive visual aids if necessary, and their environment will be modified accordingly. Client participation HHC will ensure that clients are involved during the falls prevention processes. We will: \u2022 provide information which frames falls prevention as a means for clients to remain independent for longer; \u2022 provide information on \u2018falls prevention\u2019 to clients in a manner they understand; \u2022 seek client input in discussions about preventing falls; \u2022 develop falls prevention programs which accommodate the individual client\u2019s needs; and \u2022 identify potential barriers the client may face when taking part in actions to prevent falls. Staff training HHC\u2019s Registered staff will be trained on how to undertake screening and assessment of new clients to determine if they are a high or low falls risk. The Registered staff will be trained on how to identify potential barriers or hazards which could result in falls and injury. The care staff responsible for assisting clients who wear hip-protectors will undertake relevant training on the correct application of hip protectors. Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 2|Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy Management Strategies Feet and footwear Clients\u2019 footwear will be reviewed regularly to ensure it meets the safety guidelines. Clients will be encouraged to wear soft soled shoes as opposed to slippers. Clients will also be encouraged to wear footwear when walking, to avoid the increased risk of falling barefoot. The facility will, where possible, provide grip socks to all clients who present a high falls risk, to wear during the night. Clients will be offerreded to be referred to a podiatrist on arrival if they present with foot issues which require specialised attention, who may assist in falls prevention. Environmental considerations HHC will monitor the client\u2019s environment and be attentive to feedback concerning near misses and recommend mitigation strategies where fall risks are identified, including to report to My Aged Care for reassessment to get assistance with Home modifications. Minimising injuries from falls Hip protectors will be given to clients who require them. HHC will consider the clients\u2019 falls history, mobility, steadiness, gait, disability status, osteoporosis and body index when deciding whether to use hip-protectors. HHC will also ensure that clients who require assistance to use hip-protectors receive the necessary support. Restraints HHC will not apply restraints at anytime or under any circumstances. If a staff member is at risk of harm, they are advised to exit the client\u2019s home to a safe place before reporting to the Case manager of office personnel. Observation HHC will work with the client and/or their representative to ensure that higher falls risk clients are closely observed, such as via regular phone calls. Clients with dementia and other clients who have a high risk of falling, will be encouraged to apply devices which can detect their falls and send responses to designated contacts. Continence Clients will also be offered continence assessments to check if they have problems that can be modified or prevented. Improving balance with mobility and exercise HHC will develop tailored physical activity and exercise programs for clients to help strengthen and improve stability, strength and mobility. HHC will assess balance, strength and mobility through a variety of tools and tests. These tests may include: - functional reach - six-metre walk - timed up-and-go - sit-to-stand - spring balance Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 3|Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy Medication management Case managers, Registered Staff and Care workers should be aware of the medications each client is taking and how those medications effect whether they are a high or low risk patient (e.g. knowing antidepressants are associated with higher risk of falls). HHC will encourage all clients who experience a fall have their medications reviewed by a pharmacist. Responding to Falls All clients who have a fall, will undergo a post-fall assessment taken by Registered staff. All falls will be documented and recorded by Registered staff. Responding to falls checklist No. 1 3 4 6 Item Tick when complete Offer basic support and provide immediate reassurance 2 Take baseline measures including: - pulse - blood pressure - respiratory rate - oxygen saturation - blood sugar levels - if client hit head \u2013 record neurological observations and inform medical officer for further investigation. Check for injuries Move the client - assess whether it is safe to move them - use a lifting device and comply with lifting procedures 5 Monitor the resident: - for potential internal bleeding (if alcoholic or on blood thinning medications) - ensure continued monitoring of the resident in case injuries appear later Report the fall to a medical officer immediately. 7 Record the fall - include details on client\u2019s medical record, location of fall, evidence of injury, response - type of fall - dependency of client on staff/aids - clothing, footwear and eyewear if relevant at time of fall - changes in medication - restraints used - observation at the time - contributing environmental factors - witnesses to the fall Discuss the fall and future risk management strategies 8 Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 4|Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy Client records HHC will ensure that all clients\u2019 falls risk status and falls history is recorded in their client file/individualised management plan.

It is particularly common for older Australians living in aged care facilities to experience falls. Hope Holistic Care (HHC) is committed to taking necessary measures to prevent falls and fall-related harm from occurring in our facilities. We will ensure appropriate falls assessment, prevention and management strategies are effectively implemented. We will also ensure that workers are adequately trained on how to assess, identify and mitigate falls. Definitions Syncope (fainting): is a temporary loss of consciousness, often related to insufficient blood flow to the brain. Most commonly occurring when blood pressure is too low, and the heart doesn\u2019t pump enough oxygen to the brain. Polypharmacy: is the concurrent use of multiple medications by a patient. Vestibular dysfunction: is a common cause of dizziness among the older population. Continence: is the ability of a person to control bowel and bladder movements. Procedures Risk Screening and Assessment HHC will conduct a screening and assessment of all clients in our facilities upon arrival and every six months. This falls risk screening process will be undertaken by a Registered Nurse and will include the following assessment from the best practice guidelines, to determine if the resident is a high or low falls risk. After determining the risk category of each client, an individualised management plan will be developed by Registered staff which outlines the main falls risks and mitigations strategies. The management plan will be used so that all staff are aware of the risks posed to each individual client, and any additional environmental or medical strategies which may need to be implemented. Syncope (fainting) All clients will be assessed for syncope on arrival at the facility. Presyncope, syncope and postural hypotension will be included when developing the client\u2019s management plan for falls prevention. The root causes of clients who report having unexplained falls or episodes will be identified and addressed. Dizziness and vertigo Clients will be assessed for vestibular dysfunction if they experience dizziness, vertigo or imbalance. Vestibular rehabilitation will be implemented to treat dizziness and balance problems where indicated. Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 1|Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy Vision Clients will receive an eye examination on arrival to determine if they have cataracts. Clients who have severe visual impairments will receive visual aids if necessary, and their environment will be modified accordingly. Client participation HHC will ensure that clients are involved during the falls prevention processes. We will: \u2022 provide information which frames falls prevention as a means for clients to remain independent for longer; \u2022 provide information on \u2018falls prevention\u2019 to clients in a manner they understand; \u2022 seek client input in discussions about preventing falls; \u2022 develop falls prevention programs which accommodate the individual client\u2019s needs; and \u2022 identify potential barriers the client may face when taking part in actions to prevent falls. Staff training HHC\u2019s Registered staff will be trained on how to undertake screening and assessment of new clients to determine if they are a high or low falls risk. The Registered staff will be trained on how to identify potential barriers or hazards which could result in falls and injury. The care staff responsible for assisting clients who wear hip-protectors will undertake relevant training on the correct application of hip protectors. Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 2|Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy Management Strategies Feet and footwear Clients\u2019 footwear will be reviewed regularly to ensure it meets the safety guidelines. Clients will be encouraged to wear soft soled shoes as opposed to slippers. Clients will also be encouraged to wear footwear when walking, to avoid the increased risk of falling barefoot. The facility will, where possible, provide grip socks to all clients who present a high falls risk, to wear during the night. Clients will be offerreded to be referred to a podiatrist on arrival if they present with foot issues which require specialised attention, who may assist in falls prevention. Environmental considerations HHC will monitor the client\u2019s environment and be attentive to feedback concerning near misses and recommend mitigation strategies where fall risks are identified, including to report to My Aged Care for reassessment to get assistance with Home modifications. Minimising injuries from falls Hip protectors will be given to clients who require them. HHC will consider the clients\u2019 falls history, mobility, steadiness, gait, disability status, osteoporosis and body index when deciding whether to use hip-protectors. HHC will also ensure that clients who require assistance to use hip-protectors receive the necessary support. Restraints HHC will not apply restraints at anytime or under any circumstances. If a staff member is at risk of harm, they are advised to exit the client\u2019s home to a safe place before reporting to the Case manager of office personnel. Observation HHC will work with the client and/or their representative to ensure that higher falls risk clients are closely observed, such as via regular phone calls. Clients with dementia and other clients who have a high risk of falling, will be encouraged to apply devices which can detect their falls and send responses to designated contacts. Continence Clients will also be offered continence assessments to check if they have problems that can be modified or prevented.
