Following an incident, HHC\u2019s investigation and resolution processes are outcomes-focused and conducted in line with the principles of Open Disclosure. HHC is committed to ensuring that all incidents and near misses which occur in relation to the provision of services are managed consistently and effectively, and that workers can identify, manage, report and resolve incidents. The organisation collects and reviews data on incidents in order to inform improvement activities. HHC regularly reviews its incident management system and processes to ensure that they are: Well documented; Readily accessible to all workers employed or engaged by the organisation; Reflective and adaptive, with an intent to prevent incidents; and Compliant with the Serious Incident Response Scheme. Definitions Commission Incidents Reportable incidents refers to the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission are acts, omissions, events or circumstances that occur or could occur during or in relation to the provision of care and services, or the alteration or withdrawal of care and services, that cause harm, either physically or emotionally, to a worker, consumer, or other stakeholder. Incidents also include acts, omissions, events or circumstances that have caused or could cause damage to property, the environment, material or cause public alarm. are alleged, suspected or actual incidents which have occurred in connection with service delivery, where the person affected by the incident is a consumer, of severity that must be reported to the Commission. This includes but is not limited to: \u2022 Unexpected death; \u2022 Unexplained absence; \u2022 Unreasonable use of force; \u2022 Psychological or emotional abuse; \u2022 Neglect; \u2022 Unlawful or inappropriate sexual contact; \u2022 Stealing or financial coercion by a staff member; and \u2022 Inappropriate physical or chemical restraint. are Reportable Incidents of a higher level of harm than Priority 2 incidents and must be reported to the Commission within a more immediate timeframe. Priority 1 incidents include: \u2022 Physical or psychological injury or illness requiring onsite medical or psychological treatment to resolve; \u2022 Incidents where there are reasonable grounds to report the incident to police; or Priority 1 incidents Incident Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 1|Page Incident Management Policy Priority 2 incidents Workers Procedures \u2022 A consumer\u2019s unexpected death or a consumer\u2019s unexplained absence from the service.

All \u2018Priority 2\u2019 incidents must be reported to the Commission within 30 days. are staff, contractors and volunteers employed or engaged by HHC Induction and staff training All workers must be familiar with the organisation\u2019s incident management system, understand the organisation\u2019s definition of Reportable Incidents, Priority 1 and Priority 2 incidents, and understand the procedures they must follow for reporting all incidents to the organisation and the Commission (if required). HHC promotes a culture of open reporting and ensures that all workers understand that they are supported to report any incident or alleged incident, and that there will be no negative consequences for doing so. Incident identification If a worker observes an incident, or a consumer or member of the public notifies a worker about an incident that does or could cause permanent or temporary detriment to a consumer, worker or other stakeholder, then the worker must report the incident to the Home Care Manager. Workers and consumers will be protected against any adverse actions as a result of reporting or alleging that an incident has occurred. Immediate response, and risk mitigation Where possible, an incident will first be addressed by the organisation\u2019s personnel responsible and qualified to effectively manage the incident as it takes place. First responders understand that they must contact emergency services if the situation warrants. The principle is reduce harm, reduce risks and provide support. \u2022 Reduce harm as much as possible (First aid) \u2022 Reduce risks e.g. consider providing paid leave to distressed workers \u2022 Provide support to those affected. Notification procedures Staff must report incidents to various agencies and persons based on the following priority system: \u2022 For incidents of a serious nature workers must first contact emergency services. \u2022 Workers must report all incidents and near misses internally to the Home Care Manager \u2022 If it is determined that the incident is a Reportable Incident, the Home Care Manager is responsible for notifying families, guardians and advocates of the consumer. Incident Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 2|Page Incident Management Policy \u2022 If an incident is a Reportable Incident, the Home Care Manager will determine whether it is a Priority 1 or Priority 2 incident (with the help of the Commission\u2019s Decision Support Tool), and notify the Commission within the expected timeframe of the Commission. Reporting will be done through the My Aged Care Provider Portal. External Reporting 1) Police If HHC becomes aware of a Reportable Incident of a serious nature, it will be reported to police. This includes in cases: \u2022 In which a Reportable Incident is only suspected or alleged to have occurred; \u2022 Where there are reasonable grounds to notify police; or \u2022 Where the Reportable Incident is criminal in nature. HHC will notify the consumer and/or their representative if an incident has been reported to the police. 2) Commission - Timeframes Unexplained absence from care will first be reported to the police, then to the Commission as soon as possible, and not later than 24 hours after the absence was reported to the police. All Priority 1 incidents will be reported, at a minimum, to the Commission in a two-stage process: \u2022 Within 24 hours: incident notification to the Commission and reporting to police where necessary; and \u2022 Within 5 business days: incident status report. All Priority 2 incidents will be reported to the Commission within 30 days of HHC either suspecting or becoming aware of the actual incident. HHC will respond promptly to any further questions from the Commission, and provide a final report if required by the Commission. If required by the Commission, a final report will be provided within 84 business days. The final report will include findings from investigative processes, as well as any additional details required by the Commission. If significant new information comes to light in relation to a Reportable Incident which has already been reported to the Commission, the Home Care Manager is responsible for informing the Commission as soon as possible, using the Commission-approved form. 3) Consider other Legislated/Mandatory Reporting requirements \u2022 Practitioner Conduct: These may include legislated \u2018mandatory reporting\u2019 to AHPRA if there is concern about conduct regarding registered practitioners (see AHPRA guidance).

Consumers and others affected by an incident will be involved in the management and resolution of the incident where appropriate. Consumers and other stakeholders will be informed of HHC\u2019s incident management system, and will have access to this policy. Assessment and investigation The Home Care Manager is responsible for creating an initial assessment of any incident, to determine the severity of an incident and to establish the need for, and scope of, an investigation. If an incident is a Reportable Incident, an internal investigation will take place. All investigations will be undertaken and conducted in accordance with principles of natural justice and procedural fairness. Incidents involving criminal allegations will be reported to law enforcement, who will receive full support of the organisation in their investigations. Whenever an investigation into an incident is conducted, it should establish: \u2022 The cause of the incident; \u2022 The effect of the incident; \u2022 Any organisational processes that contributed to or did not function in preventing the incident; \u2022 Changes the organisation can make to prevent further incidents from occurring; \u2022 What, if any, remedial action must be undertaken to prevent or minimise future incidents; and \u2022 The effectiveness of HHC \u2018s incident management system in relation to the incident. Information related to incident investigations, including records of phone conversations, emails, documents and, where possible, records of face-to-face interviews will be recorded and kept in strict confidence.

All Priority 2 incidents will be reported to the Commission within 30 days of HHC either suspecting or becoming aware of the actual incident. HHC will respond promptly to any further questions from the Commission, and provide a final report if required by the Commission. If required by the Commission, a final report will be provided within 84 business days.
