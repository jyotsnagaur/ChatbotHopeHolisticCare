Discuss with Supervisor: Discuss these observations with your supervisor or Case Manager to ensure appropriate follow-up actions are considered. Use Thermometer if Required: If necessary, use the client's thermometer to take their temperature, which can provide valuable data about their health status. Arrange Medical Assessment: If the concerns are significant or if there are noticeable changes in health, mobility, or cognition, consider the need for an urgent appointment with the client's medical practitioner. Rapid Response if Severe: Should the deterioration be severe, activate rapid response systems immediately, which may involve calling emergency services (000). Escalation of Care: Escalate care accordingly, which should be a graded response taking into account the client's current health status, their care preferences, and the absolute changes in their vital signs or other observations. Communicating for Safety: The communication process should include identifying the client and sharing relevant information with all who are involved in their care, including the medical practitioner. The client's preferences and advance care plans should be discussed at the earliest appropriate opportunity, ensuring that care documentation and the care plan are updated accordingly .
