Code of Conduct for aged care and Ethical Behaviour Older people depend on us in varying capacities to maintain their well-being and live a quality life. We have the power to help them. Therefore, we need to be mindful to use our abilities to support older people and protect them from harm. We would do well to: 1. Act with respect for individual rights to freedom of expression, self-determination, and decision- making in accordance with relevant laws and conventions 2. Act in a way that treats people with dignity and respect, and values their diversity 3. Respect the privacy of everyone 4. Provide services in a safe and competent manner with care and skill 5. Act with integrity, honesty, and transparency 6. Promptly take steps to raise and act on concerns about matters that might have an impact on the quality and safety of services provided to people who are vulnerable 7. Provide care, supports and services free from: (i) all forms of violence, discrimination, exploitation, neglect and abuse (ii) sexual misconduct 8.

We need to remember to protect their confidentiality, and only share information to those who are also involved with their care. Before sharing any information, think about why you are sharing it. If it is necessary, be mindful to share only what needs to be known for that purpose. Also, think about whether you would like others talking about you in the same way. This applies to our colleagues and company information as well. Remember that we entrust each other with our information so that we can help meet each other\u2019s needs. \u201cDo not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen.\u201d Ephesians 4:29 If you want to know more about this subject, you can access our Privacy Policy or talk to your manager about it. Safety, Security and Abuse When clients open their home to us, they are giving us a lot of power. We need to be mindful of this and use it responsibly. In everything we do or say, it\u2019s important that we do so safely, as well as making them feel safe and secure. Abuse can occur when we come across as threatening, disrespectful; when we ignore their needs; when we touch them inappropriately; when we use physical force, or take advantage of their belongings, such as money. It is best that we treat our clients and colleagues with respect and humility. We need to show our concern for them by asking them if they feel safe and take actions if they say otherwise. \u201cDo not devise harm against your neighbour, while he lives securely beside you.\u201d Proverbs 3:29 If you want to find out more, you can refer to our Abuse and Neglect Policy or talk to your manager about it. Appearance Appearance can affect the comfort of clients we serve as well as what they think of the organisation. Therefore, we should always dress appropriately, being presentable, professional, clean, neat and tidy. All Care staff will be supplied with at least one HHC uniform shirt by the Office. Please use it and wash regularly. Appearance Guidelines Please follow the below guidelines: \u2022 Identification badges should be worn to let clients know your name Staff Handbook 2|Page Staff Handbook \u2022 In general, shoes should be sturdy, low heeled, protect the foot and have slip-resistant soles.

Hair When providing direct care, please tie your hair back if it is longer than shoulder length for hygiene purposes. Personal Items We should only be bringing what we need into the house. Consider bringing a small bag and keep it near the entrance of the home. This is to prevent suspicions of theft by the client. Try not to bring many personal items into the residence. Jewellery/Nails For safety purposes, when providing care, we should not wear rings (other than wedding bands), bracelets (other than medical alert bracelets), very long fingernails, nail polish, drop earrings and necklaces. Ear studs may be worn. This is to preserve the skin integrity of our clients and prevent unnecessary injury. Mobile phones We should generally refrain from using our mobile phones for personal reasons when working with a client. It is best to be kept in your bag so that you can pay attention to the client. If you are expecting an important call, notify the client in advance and minimise the time spent on the call. Smoking For the health and safety of our clients and colleagues, all working environments, including the client\u2019s house and surrounds, are smoke-free. We encourage all staff to refrain from smoking whilst on shift and/or whilst travelling between clients. Hygiene and Infection Control Our clients can get very sick if they are infected with viruses or bacteria into their home. For the safety of them and us, we should keep ourselves clean and use personal protective equipment at appropriate times. This includes regular hand sanitisation, mask and glove wearing.

Discrimination and Harassment Hope Holistic Care strives to maintain a working environment free from all forms of harassment or intimidation. Threatening, insulting or abusive words or behaviour towards another, or by displaying threatening, insulting or abusive words or pictures, unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favours and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature are serious violations of our policy and will not be condoned or permitted. HHC will not tolerate behaviour which is offensive, intimidating, humiliating, malicious, insulting or embarrassing and which is aimed at making an individual or group of individuals feel miserable, humiliated or lacking in self-confidence. It is expected that people in our workplace will behave in accordance with our Code of Ethical Behaviour. All reports of harassment, victimisation and bullying will be taken seriously, managed promptly and be treated with sensitivity and confidentiality. Staff Handbook 4|Page Staff Handbook Responsibilities Everyone is responsible to create and maintain a workplace environment that is free from any form of harassment. Managers and Supervisors Managers and supervisors must ensure that acceptable standards of behaviour are maintained in the workplace and have communicated the message that harassment will not be tolerated within the workplace. To meet these requirements, managers should: \u2022 Ensure the work environment is free from discriminatory practices and unwelcome or offensive behaviour \u2022 Treat harassment seriously, actively intervene and take early corrective action to deal with any behaviour or actions that may be considered inappropriate \u2022 Handle any complaints in a fair, confidential and expeditious manner \u2022 Ensure reprisal toward affected individuals does not occur \u2022 Model appropriate behaviour \u2022 Seek assistance from HR where there is any issue pertaining to harassment Staff Members and Volunteers All staff and volunteers are required to maintain acceptable standards of conduct and ensure that work is carried out in an environment free from all forms of harassment. All employees should: \u2022 Reject immediately, any behaviour that is unwelcome and offensive \u2022 Report any incident of harassment or bullying \u2022 Not harass or bully, or participate in any behaviour that harasses or bullies other people Staff who become aware of harassment of others should: \u2022 Advise their manager in the first instance \u2022 Provide advice and assistance in making an informal or formal complaint \u2022 Maintain confidentiality when providing information in an investigation Dispute and Grievance Settlement It is the responsibility of the organisation to provide you with the time, forums and mechanisms so you can tell us what you want us to hear. We encourage all employees to take responsibility for raising issues in a constructive way that will allow the organisation to acknowledge and take appropriate action. Any employee who believes that they have been unfairly treated, has the right to discuss the issue with their manager. Every manager within the organisation who has a grievance brought to their attention has the following obligations: \u2022 To take the matter seriously \u2022 To record the conversation and any agreed outcome \u2022 To refer the matter to an appropriate person who can help the manager and employee resolve the issue In extreme circumstances, Hope Holistic Care may seek the assistance of an external qualified grievance management body to assist in resolving the matter. Staff Handbook 5|Page Staff Handbook A grievance should be lodged in writing and must identify the nature of the grievance, all of the persons involved, and the time and location in which the incident is reported to have arisen. Anonymous grievances will not be pursued by Hope Holistic Care. Senior management will treat all issues fairly, confidentially and without repercussions. False allegations are considered by Hope Holistic Care to be deliberate and wilful misconduct. Performance Management and Disciplinary Action The purpose of the performance management and disciplinary processes are to outline the steps that are required to be taken in order to resolve a performance management issue or a breach of terms and conditions of employment or organisation policy. This procedure is used to: \u2022 Ensure fair treatment of staff at all times \u2022 Establish a consistent approach to handling disciplinary matters \u2022 Ensure that staff effort is channelled in the right direction \u2022 Bring about a suitable change in any undesirable conduct/performance \u2022 Prevent a situation of consistently unsatisfactory conduct/performance arising The purpose of counselling is to advise the staff member of any performance/conduct of concern and to establish if the organisation can provide assistance to avoid further instances of unacceptable performance/ conduct, whether through training, coaching or some other action. Summary Dismissal If you exhibit behaviour or engage in action that is either unlawful, negligent, or grossly offensive, you may be summarily dismissed. Examples include, but are not limited to: abuse, drug/alcohol abuse, misappropriation of funds, falsification of records, wilful refusal to obey reasonable directions and organisational policies/procedures. Information systems Hope Holistic Care uses the LookOutWay application to roster, assign shifts and communicate client information such as Care Plans or notes to you. At orientation, you will receive instructions on how to set up your login to the LookOutWay app. You will be able to download this app on your phone.

            "Hope Holistic Care takes harassment issues very seriously and has policies in place to manage and address such situations in the workplace. Here's how the organization handles harassment: Creating a Harassment-Free Environment: Each individual in the organization is responsible for creating and maintaining an environment free from harassment. Managers and supervisors are specifically tasked with ensuring acceptable standards of behavior are maintained and that harassment is not tolerated. They are required to treat complaints seriously and intervene early to correct inappropriate behavior . Reporting Harassment: Staff members and volunteers who experience or witness harassment are instructed to reject unwelcome and offensive behavior immediately and report any incidents of harassment or bullying. The first point of contact is typically the individual's manager. Handling Complaints: Complaints of harassment are to be handled fairly, confidentially, and promptly. Managers are obligated to record the conversation and any outcomes and refer the matter to the appropriate person to help resolve the issue. In extreme circumstances, Hope Holistic Care may seek the assistance of an external qualified grievance management body . Support and Counselling: Support, including counseling, is arranged for both the client and workers who may be suffering as a result of the incident. Case managers ensure clients and their families are kept informed of all measures being taken and provide regular updates on the progress of any investigation . Protection of Whistleblowers: The organization has developed clear Whistleblower protections to encourage transparency and to ensure that harassment and other abuse do not go unreported. This includes protection against retribution or punishment for those who make a complaint or disclose any potential or actual abusive or neglectful practice . Disciplinary Action: Hope Holistic Care will take disciplinary action against any staff member who violates harassment policies, fails to report, or attempts to cover up incidents of potential abuse. This can range up to dismissal for grave offences and may include action taken by the police . If one experiences harassment at work, it is imperative to follow these guidelines and report the incident to their manager or HR department. All reports will be taken seriously and handled with sensitivity. The organization is committed to ensuring a safe work environment where such incidents are addressed appropriately and in accordance with their policies on harassment and wellbeing."

HHC will not tolerate behaviour which is offensive, intimidating, humiliating, malicious, insulting or embarrassing and which is aimed at making an individual or group of individuals feel miserable, humiliated or lacking in self-confidence. It is expected that people in our workplace will behave in accordance with our Code of Ethical Behaviour. All reports of harassment, victimisation and bullying will be taken seriously, managed promptly and be treated with sensitivity and confidentiality. Staff Handbook 4|Page Staff Handbook Responsibilities Everyone is responsible to create and maintain a workplace environment that is free from any form of harassment. Managers and Supervisors Managers and supervisors must ensure that acceptable standards of behaviour are maintained in the workplace and have communicated the message that harassment will not be tolerated within the workplace. To meet these requirements, managers should: \u2022 Ensure the work environment is free from discriminatory practices and unwelcome or offensive behaviour \u2022 Treat harassment seriously, actively intervene and take early corrective action to deal with any behaviour or actions that may be considered inappropriate \u2022 Handle any complaints in a fair, confidential and expeditious manner \u2022 Ensure reprisal toward affected individuals does not occur \u2022 Model appropriate behaviour \u2022 Seek assistance from HR where there is any issue pertaining to harassment Staff Members and Volunteers All staff and volunteers are required to maintain acceptable standards of conduct and ensure that work is carried out in an environment free from all forms of harassment. All employees should: \u2022 Reject immediately, any behaviour that is unwelcome and offensive \u2022 Report any incident of harassment or bullying \u2022 Not harass or bully, or participate in any behaviour that harasses or bullies other people Staff who become aware of harassment of others should: \u2022 Advise their manager in the first instance \u2022 Provide advice and assistance in making an informal or formal complaint \u2022 Maintain confidentiality when providing information in an investigation Dispute and Grievance Settlement It is the responsibility of the organisation to provide you with the time, forums and mechanisms so you can tell us what you want us to hear. We encourage all employees to take responsibility for raising issues in a constructive way that will allow the organisation to acknowledge and take appropriate action. Any employee who believes that they have been unfairly treated, has the right to discuss the issue with their manager. Every manager within the organisation who has a grievance brought to their attention has the following obligations: \u2022 To take the matter seriously \u2022 To record the conversation and any agreed outcome \u2022 To refer the matter to an appropriate person who can help the manager and employee resolve the issue In extreme circumstances, Hope Holistic Care may seek the assistance of an external qualified grievance management body to assist in resolving the matter. Staff Handbook 5|Page Staff Handbook A grievance should be lodged in writing and must identify the nature of the grievance, all of the persons involved, and the time and location in which the incident is reported to have arisen. Anonymous grievances will not be pursued by Hope Holistic Care. Senior management will treat all issues fairly, confidentially and without repercussions. False allegations are considered by Hope Holistic Care to be deliberate and wilful misconduct. Performance Management and Disciplinary Action The purpose of the performance management and disciplinary processes are to outline the steps that are required to be taken in order to resolve a performance management issue or a breach of terms and conditions of employment or organisation policy. This procedure is used to: \u2022 Ensure fair treatment of staff at all times \u2022 Establish a consistent approach to handling disciplinary matters \u2022 Ensure that staff effort is channelled in the right direction \u2022 Bring about a suitable change in any undesirable conduct/performance \u2022 Prevent a situation of consistently unsatisfactory conduct/performance arising The purpose of counselling is to advise the staff member of any performance/conduct of concern and to establish if the organisation can provide assistance to avoid further instances of unacceptable performance/ conduct, whether through training, coaching or some other action. Summary Dismissal If you exhibit behaviour or engage in action that is either unlawful, negligent, or grossly offensive, you may be summarily dismissed. Examples include, but are not limited to: abuse, drug/alcohol abuse, misappropriation of funds, falsification of records, wilful refusal to obey reasonable directions and organisational policies/procedures.

You have joined an organization that strives to help older Australians remain independent and healthy living at home. At the end of the day, if our clients recognize that we are helping them make the best of their lives, we\u2019ve done our job. We all need to work together to achieve this. We want you to do your best work and enjoy serving our clients. This handbook is about how we will work and support each other to make this happen. It is not meant to be exhaustive; so if you are ever unsure of things, we want you to let us know. We look forward to you starting with us and may you find the journey meaningful and fulfilling. \u201cAnd now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.\u201d 1 Corinthians 13:13 Our Vision, Mission and Values Hope Holistic Care wants to build a community for older people to share eternal hope. A community comprises of clients, families, staff, health professionals and community service providers. We work to find the right people to deliver the right service at the right time with the right attitude. Working with HHC We work on the basis of trust, respect, honesty, openness and the principles of the Charter of aged care right. Communication is important and we want to make sure everyone is comfortable to raise suggestions or concerns. We try hard to achieve a win-win situation for everyone; this requires patience and understanding. Where this isn\u2019t possible, we rely on grace and mercy, having a focus on our client\u2019s outcomes. Staff Handbook Orientation When you first join us, we will send you information about standard practices and setup communication systems, including information technology. We will introduce you to our team of staff via a social app. If you have any questions, you will be able to contact a member of our office team. Scheduling availability and requests We will ask you when you are available to work. We will generally assign clients that fit your availability. We ask that we work together to find the best possible outcome for the client. We know that things change, so we will ask that you update your availability with us on a regular basis. Please let us know of changes at least 2 weeks or more in advance. Assigning client services When a client service is assigned to you, our office team will give you some background on the client so that you know what to expect. You will find the client\u2019s care plan in the app for more information. If you are replacing someone on a shift, we will also provide a handover to help the client experience a seamless service. To find out more about what how to be successful in delivering services to our clients, please refer to the Things to be mindful of section. After the service, we will contact you to discuss how you went. We will also contact the client so that we can resolve any issues quickly to ensure positive experiences in future visits. Ongoing communications and feedback We enjoy open communications about clients, how to support you and opportunities to improve; therefore, please let us know if you have anything to share! You contact your manager directly, ring 02 7228 1369 or email info@hopehc.org.au to talk to us. If you want to provide anonymous feedback, you can do so by sending us a letter to our office. Code of Conduct for aged care and Ethical Behaviour Older people depend on us in varying capacities to maintain their well-being and live a quality life. We have the power to help them. Therefore, we need to be mindful to use our abilities to support older people and protect them from harm. We would do well to: 1. Act with respect for individual rights to freedom of expression, self-determination, and decision- making in accordance with relevant laws and conventions 2. Act in a way that treats people with dignity and respect, and values their diversity 3. Respect the privacy of everyone 4. Provide services in a safe and competent manner with care and skill 5. Act with integrity, honesty, and transparency 6. Promptly take steps to raise and act on concerns about matters that might have an impact on the quality and safety of services provided to people who are vulnerable 7. Provide care, supports and services free from: (i) all forms of violence, discrimination, exploitation, neglect and abuse (ii) sexual misconduct 8. Take all reasonable steps to prevent and respond to all forms of violence, exploitation, neglect, and abuse of people in our care Staff Handbook 1|Page Staff Handbook You can find out more about these behaviours in our Code of Ethical Conduct Policy \u201cDear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.\u201d Things to be mindful of Confidentiality 1 John 4:11 Often, we will learn things about clients other people will not know, either through conversations or reading documents. We need to remember to protect their confidentiality, and only share information to those who are also involved with their care. Before sharing any information, think about why you are sharing it. If it is necessary, be mindful to share only what needs to be known for that purpose. Also, think about whether you would like others talking about you in the same way. This applies to our colleagues and company information as well. Remember that we entrust each other with our information so that we can help meet each other\u2019s needs. \u201cDo not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen.\u201d Ephesians 4:29 If you want to know more about this subject, you can access our Privacy Policy or talk to your manager about it. Safety, Security and Abuse When clients open their home to us, they are giving us a lot of power. We need to be mindful of this and use it responsibly. In everything we do or say, it\u2019s important that we do so safely, as well as making them feel safe and secure. Abuse can occur when we come across as threatening, disrespectful; when we ignore their needs; when we touch them inappropriately; when we use physical force, or take advantage of their belongings, such as money. It is best that we treat our clients and colleagues with respect and humility. We need to show our concern for them by asking them if they feel safe and take actions if they say otherwise. \u201cDo not devise harm against your neighbour, while he lives securely beside you.\u201d Proverbs 3:29 If you want to find out more, you can refer to our Abuse and Neglect Policy or talk to your manager about it. Appearance Appearance can affect the comfort of clients we serve as well as what they think of the organisation. Therefore, we should always dress appropriately, being presentable, professional, clean, neat and tidy. All Care staff will be supplied with at least one HHC uniform shirt by the Office. Please use it and wash regularly. Appearance Guidelines Please follow the below guidelines: \u2022 Identification badges should be worn to let clients know your name Staff Handbook 2|Page Staff Handbook \u2022 In general, shoes should be sturdy, low heeled, protect the foot and have slip-resistant soles. We will wear shoe covers when we enter client\u2019s homes. \u2022 Uniforms are expected to be clean, tidy and not appear scrunched up. Hair When providing direct care, please tie your hair back if it is longer than shoulder length for hygiene purposes. Personal Items We should only be bringing what we need into the house. Consider bringing a small bag and keep it near the entrance of the home. This is to prevent suspicions of theft by the client. Try not to bring many personal items into the residence. Jewellery/Nails For safety purposes, when providing care, we should not wear rings (other than wedding bands), bracelets (other than medical alert bracelets), very long fingernails, nail polish, drop earrings and necklaces. Ear studs may be worn. This is to preserve the skin integrity of our clients and prevent unnecessary injury. Mobile phones We should generally refrain from using our mobile phones for personal reasons when working with a client. It is best to be kept in your bag so that you can pay attention to the client. If you are expecting an important call, notify the client in advance and minimise the time spent on the call. Smoking For the health and safety of our clients and colleagues, all working environments, including the client\u2019s house and surrounds, are smoke-free. We encourage all staff to refrain from smoking whilst on shift and/or whilst travelling between clients. Hygiene and Infection Control Our clients can get very sick if they are infected with viruses or bacteria into their home. For the safety of them and us, we should keep ourselves clean and use personal protective equipment at appropriate times. This includes regular hand sanitisation, mask and glove wearing. You should always have these supplies with you. If you need to replenish them, please contact the office and we will arrange to deliver these to you. Please read the Infection Prevention and Control Policy and talk to your manager if you have any questions. Work Health and Safety Your health and safety are important to HHC. HHC is committed to the following: \u2022 Regularly talk to you and ask you about work health and safety \u2022 Develop safe procedures for everyone to use every day, including for emergencies \u2022 Provide reporting systems and injury management What we need you to do is to: \u2022 Use of the Home Safety Checklist at the client\u2019s home before services start \u2022 Take care for the safety of yourself and others Staff Handbook 3|Page Staff Handbook \u2022 Comply with health and safety directions \u2022 Report incidents and injury immediately \u2022 Report and control hazards as you identify them, and report to management as needed Learning and Development We learn by experience and seeking answers to questions that come up in what we do each day. Therefore, HHC will actively encourage individual staff to reflect on the clients and services to identify opportunities for learning. We also organise group education sessions on topics that have been raised through client needs, staff requests and as required by industry standards or legislation. Employee relations Probation For Permanent or full-time staff, we generally provide a probationary period of 3 months, unless there is written notice from us to indicate otherwise. Payroll Enquiries Hope Holistic Care operates on a fortnightly pay cycle. Please contact the Office for any payroll enquiries Salary Packaging Hope Holistic Care is classified as a \u201cpublic benevolent institution\u201d (PBI). Therefore, it is able to offer full-time and part-time employees salary packaging \u2013 reimbursing employees\u2019 bills (tax free) up to $15,900 per annum. For more information, please contact the Office. Travel When visiting clients, the first trip to the client from your home and the last trip returning home will not be included in the mileage reimbursement. We will calculate the mileage for travel between the clients based on Google Maps and automatically pay you as travel allowance. If you assist the client with transportation or shopping during the visit, you will be able to report it in the app to claim reimbursement. Unless specified, there will not be any reimbursement for tolls paid during the travel to clients\u2019 homes. Parking fines or any traffic infringements are not payable by HHC. Discrimination and Harassment Hope Holistic Care strives to maintain a working environment free from all forms of harassment or intimidation.

We need to remember to protect their confidentiality, and only share information to those who are also involved with their care. Before sharing any information, think about why you are sharing it. If it is necessary, be mindful to share only what needs to be known for that purpose. Also, think about whether you would like others talking about you in the same way. This applies to our colleagues and company information as well. Remember that we entrust each other with our information so that we can help meet each other\u2019s needs. \u201cDo not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen.\u201d Ephesians 4:29 If you want to know more about this subject, you can access our Privacy Policy or talk to your manager about it. Safety, Security and Abuse When clients open their home to us, they are giving us a lot of power. We need to be mindful of this and use it responsibly. In everything we do or say, it\u2019s important that we do so safely, as well as making them feel safe and secure. Abuse can occur when we come across as threatening, disrespectful; when we ignore their needs; when we touch them inappropriately; when we use physical force, or take advantage of their belongings, such as money. It is best that we treat our clients and colleagues with respect and humility. We need to show our concern for them by asking them if they feel safe and take actions if they say otherwise. \u201cDo not devise harm against your neighbour, while he lives securely beside you.\u201d Proverbs 3:29 If you want to find out more, you can refer to our Abuse and Neglect Policy or talk to your manager about it.

It is expected that people in our workplace will behave in accordance with our Code of Ethical Behaviour. All reports of harassment, victimisation and bullying will be taken seriously, managed promptly and be treated with sensitivity and confidentiality. Staff Handbook 4|Page Staff Handbook Responsibilities Everyone is responsible to create and maintain a workplace environment that is free from any form of harassment. Managers and Supervisors Managers and supervisors must ensure that acceptable standards of behaviour are maintained in the workplace and have communicated the message that harassment will not be tolerated within the workplace. To meet these requirements, managers should: \u2022 Ensure the work environment is free from discriminatory practices and unwelcome or offensive behaviour \u2022 Treat harassment seriously, actively intervene and take early corrective action to deal with any behaviour or actions that may be considered inappropriate \u2022 Handle any complaints in a fair, confidential and expeditious manner \u2022 Ensure reprisal toward affected individuals does not occur \u2022 Model appropriate behaviour \u2022 Seek assistance from HR where there is any issue pertaining to harassment Staff Members and Volunteers All staff and volunteers are required to maintain acceptable standards of conduct and ensure that work is carried out in an environment free from all forms of harassment. All employees should: \u2022 Reject immediately, any behaviour that is unwelcome and offensive \u2022 Report any incident of harassment or bullying \u2022 Not harass or bully, or participate in any behaviour that harasses or bullies other people Staff who become aware of harassment of others should: \u2022 Advise their manager in the first instance \u2022 Provide advice and assistance in making an informal or formal complaint \u2022 Maintain confidentiality when providing information in an investigation Dispute and Grievance Settlement It is the responsibility of the organisation to provide you with the time, forums and mechanisms so you can tell us what you want us to hear. We encourage all employees to take responsibility for raising issues in a constructive way that will allow the organisation to acknowledge and take appropriate action. Any employee who believes that they have been unfairly treated, has the right to discuss the issue with their manager. Every manager within the organisation who has a grievance brought to their attention has the following obligations: \u2022 To take the matter seriously \u2022 To record the conversation and any agreed outcome \u2022 To refer the matter to an appropriate person who can help the manager and employee resolve the issue In extreme circumstances, Hope Holistic Care may seek the assistance of an external qualified grievance management body to assist in resolving the matter. Staff Handbook 5|Page Staff Handbook A grievance should be lodged in writing and must identify the nature of the grievance, all of the persons involved, and the time and location in which the incident is reported to have arisen. Anonymous grievances will not be pursued by Hope Holistic Care. Senior management will treat all issues fairly, confidentially and without repercussions. False allegations are considered by Hope Holistic Care to be deliberate and wilful misconduct. Performance Management and Disciplinary Action The purpose of the performance management and disciplinary processes are to outline the steps that are required to be taken in order to resolve a performance management issue or a breach of terms and conditions of employment or organisation policy. This procedure is used to: \u2022 Ensure fair treatment of staff at all times \u2022 Establish a consistent approach to handling disciplinary matters \u2022 Ensure that staff effort is channelled in the right direction \u2022 Bring about a suitable change in any undesirable conduct/performance \u2022 Prevent a situation of consistently unsatisfactory conduct/performance arising The purpose of counselling is to advise the staff member of any performance/conduct of concern and to establish if the organisation can provide assistance to avoid further instances of unacceptable performance/ conduct, whether through training, coaching or some other action.

            "For new staff members at Hope Holistic Care, the probationary period serves as a time for both the organization and the new employee to assess suitability for the role. Here's what happens during that time: Duration: The probation period for permanent or full-time staff is generally three months unless indicated otherwise in writing by the organization . Performance Evaluation: During this period, your performance will be closely observed to ensure that you meet the job requirements and fit within the organization's culture. Feedback and Review: Regular feedback will be provided to you on your performance and you may have formal or informal meetings with your supervisor to discuss your progress. Opportunity to Improve: If there are areas where improvement is needed, this will be communicated to you, and you will be given the opportunity to address these areas. End of Probation Evaluation: At the end of the probation period, your manager will conduct an evaluation to decide whether to confirm your employment, extend your probation period, or, in some cases, end your employment if the fit or performance isn't satisfactory. Communication: Throughout the probation period, you should have open communication with your supervisor. You're encouraged to ask questions, seek feedback, and clarify expectations. Documentation: Any formal reviews or feedback sessions should be documented as part of your employment records. Probation periods can differ from one organization to another, so it's important to familiarize yourself with the specific policies provided by Hope Holistic Care in their Employee Relations section of the Staff Handbook.

Any employee who believes that they have been unfairly treated, has the right to discuss the issue with their manager. Every manager within the organisation who has a grievance brought to their attention has the following obligations: \u2022 To take the matter seriously \u2022 To record the conversation and any agreed outcome \u2022 To refer the matter to an appropriate person who can help the manager and employee resolve the issue In extreme circumstances, Hope Holistic Care may seek the assistance of an external qualified grievance management body to assist in resolving the matter. Staff Handbook 5|Page Staff Handbook A grievance should be lodged in writing and must identify the nature of the grievance, all of the persons involved, and the time and location in which the incident is reported to have arisen. Anonymous grievances will not be pursued by Hope Holistic Care. Senior management will treat all issues fairly, confidentially and without repercussions. False allegations are considered by Hope Holistic Care to be deliberate and wilful misconduct. Performance Management and Disciplinary Action The purpose of the performance management and disciplinary processes are to outline the steps that are required to be taken in order to resolve a performance management issue or a breach of terms and conditions of employment or organisation policy. This procedure is used to: \u2022 Ensure fair treatment of staff at all times \u2022 Establish a consistent approach to handling disciplinary matters \u2022 Ensure that staff effort is channelled in the right direction \u2022 Bring about a suitable change in any undesirable conduct/performance \u2022 Prevent a situation of consistently unsatisfactory conduct/performance arising The purpose of counselling is to advise the staff member of any performance/conduct of concern and to establish if the organisation can provide assistance to avoid further instances of unacceptable performance/ conduct, whether through training, coaching or some other action. Summary Dismissal If you exhibit behaviour or engage in action that is either unlawful, negligent, or grossly offensive, you may be summarily dismissed. Examples include, but are not limited to: abuse, drug/alcohol abuse, misappropriation of funds, falsification of records, wilful refusal to obey reasonable directions and organisational policies/procedures.
