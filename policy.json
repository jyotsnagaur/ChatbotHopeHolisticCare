Relevant material and information are sought, including \ninformation from other sources where appropriate.  \nDocumentation is complied. the length and formality of communication about the \ngrievance will depend on the seriousness and complexity of the comp laint, but should \ngenerally at this stage be minimal.

Hope Holistic Care will act appropriately and in a timely manner in the event of a data breach, to contain the possible resulting harm and notify individuals affected as required.  Definitions Data Breach: When personal information held by an organisation is disclosed accidentally, lost, or accessed without permission. This can be as a result of human error, or through malicious action by an employee or an external party.   Examples include where a secure IT system containing personal information has been hacked, a storage device being lost by an employee, or an employee accidentally releasing personal information to the wrong person.  Personal information: \u2018Information about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable: whether the information or opinion is true or not; and whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not.\u2019 (Privacy Act 1988, Section 6) Procedure Identify When staff have reason to believe there has been a data breach, they should inform the Office immediately.  At this time, details such as when and how the breach was discovered, and by whom, should be recorded. This will be recorded in the incident register. Contain As soon as a breach or suspected breach has been identified, any steps to contain or limit the potential harm should be taken. This may include shutting down a system that has been breached, or recovering any records.   The CEO will complete a preliminary assessment of the breach and take any immediate action to contain the breach if possible.  Assess If the preliminary assessment finds that further investigation and assessment is necessary to understand the nature and extent of the breach, it will be escalated to the data breach response team. The team will work together to gather information, assess risks and the likelihood of serious harm from the breach, and therefore whether it is an \u2018eligible\u2019 (notifiable) breach.  To evaluate whether a known data breach is notifiable, consider the following three questions: \u2022 Has there been unauthorised access, unauthorised disclosure, accidental loss, or theft of personal information that the organisation holds?  \nData breach response plan \n2 | Page Data Breach Response Plan _POL_V01_2305  For example, the organisation\u2019s database is hacked, a portable storage device containing personal information is lost, or the organisation accidentally releases personal information to the wrong person.  \u2022 Is it likely that this may result in serious harm to individual/s whose data has been breached?   This can include but is not limited to psychological, financial, emotional, physical or reputational harm. To be able to accurately assess the likelihood and seriousness of harm, it requires looking at the context of the data and how it may have been breached.  For information about the factors to consider when deciding whether harm is likely and/or serious, refer to section 26WG of the Privacy Amendment (Notifiable Data Breaches) Act 2017 \u2022 Does the likelihood of serious harm remain despite taking available remedial action? The obligation to notify the OAIC can be avoided if the organisation takes remedial action in a timely manner to prevent the risk of harm occurring, either by making the harm unlikely to occur, or non-serious.   If the answer to the above three questions is yes, then the breach classifies as an eligible data breach and organisations are required to notify the OAIC and any affected individuals.  If there are reasonable grounds to suspect that there has been a data breach, the data response team should conduct an assessment of the suspected breach. The assessment of a suspected breach must take place within 30 days of it occurring, and should seek to find out the likelihood of serious harm occurring as a result of the suspected breach. If it is assessed to be likely, this has the same notification obligations as a known data breach under the NDB Scheme.  Take remedial action Remedial action can be taken at any point throughout the data breach response process \u2013 the sooner the better. However, it may be that the full extent and nature of the breach, and therefore the actions that could be taken, are not known until after assessing and investigating the breach.  Examples of remedial action include remotely deleting sensitive information from a laptop which has been lost, or emailing affected individuals with advice to change their password details for an online account for which login information may have been hacked.  The data breach response team should document the process of any remedial action, making sure to document rationale and reasoning as to why a certain conclusion has been made.  If, after the remedial action has been taken, the risk of harm is reduced so that it is unlikely to occur, or non-serious, then there is no requirement to notify.  Even if there is no requirement, however, the data response team should consider whether to contact affected individuals with advice for further protecting their information as a customer service measure.  Notify Once a breach has been assessed as eligible, relevant individuals and bodies should be notified as soon as practicable. Notification must include the following information as a minimum: \nData breach response plan \n3 | Page Data Breach Response Plan _POL_V01_2305  \u2022 The organisation\u2019s name and contact details \u2022 Description of the data breach \u2022 Type of information involved in the breach \u2022 Advice and recommendations for individuals to take in response  1. The OAIC The CEO is responsible for notifying and liaising with the OAIC for data breaches which have been assessed as eligible for the purposes of the Notifiable Data Breaches Scheme, using the OAIC\u2019s Notifiable Data Breach form.  2. Notification of individuals who are at likely risk of serious harm due to the data breach The way notification occurs will depend on the context and nature of the breach, and the relationship of the individuals affected to the organisation. It should occur as soon as practicable after completing the notification statement for the OAIC. Individuals may be contacted by phone and email. A public notification may also occur. Notification to affected individuals may contain an explanation of what happened to their personal information, an apology, description of what measures have been put in place as a result of the breach, and advice on what they can do to further protect their information.  Record and review  Data breach log  A data breach log will record all instances of data breaches or suspected breaches, as well as document assessments of the breach and any changes made as a result of a breach.  All staff should be made aware of the log, and the CEO will be responsible for ensuring that all breaches or suspected breaches are recorded accurately in the log.  Review Whether or not the breach or suspected breach was notifiable, a review should be conducted into processes relating to the breach to strengthen protections in the future. Depending on the type and seriousness of the breach, this may include: \u2022 A full investigation into how the breach occurred \u2022 Implement measures to ensure it does not reoccur, documented in a prevention plan \u2022 Reviews of security, cybersecurity and ICT policies and procedures \u2022 Audit of implementation of relevant policies and procedures \u2022 Additional staff training about privacy and data breach responses \n",

Hope Holistic Care understands and affirms that cognitive impairment is not a reason for a person to be excluded from the decision-making process about their own life.   Hope Holistic Care understands that not all decisions require assistance and will support clients primarily when they make significant decisions which have immediate or long-term consequences regarding their health, finances or lifestyle.  Hope Holistic Care is committed to supporting clients with complex care and communication needs to make their own decisions regarding their life.  The will and preferences of a client will only be overridden if a decision is deemed by staff or advocates to be dangerous to the wellbeing of the client or others. Definitions Decision is a planned course of action, either short or long term, regarding the lifestyle, healthcare or financial affairs of an individual. Dignity of risk is the recognition that every individual should be able to do something that has a level of risk involved, whether real or perceived. Financial Decisions include but are not limited to: \u2022 Investment decisions; \u2022 Sale or gifts of property or valuable possessions; \u2022 Use of money. Functional Capacity Assessment is an assessment of an individual\u2019s decision-making capacity in the present moment. The assessment should focus on the person\u2019s understanding of the decision, its context and consequences, and should not contain a judgement on whether a person\u2019s decision is wise or unwise. Healthcare Decisions include but are not limited to: \u2022 Seeking or obtaining a diagnosis; \nDecision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy  \n2 | Page Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy _POL_V01_2209  \u2022 Accessing (or refusing) care services; \u2022 Responding to crisis (falls, incidents); \u2022 Agreeing or refusing medical treatment; \u2022 Advance care planning. Lifestyle Decisions include but are not limited to: \u2022 Living arrangements; \u2022 Relationships; \u2022 Employment; \u2022 Civic participation; \u2022 Holidays and outings; \u2022 Pets and possessions. Representative is a person or organisation that assists the client in the decision-making process and, where necessary, makes decisions on behalf of the client. A Representative is designated by a client, or by appointment from another body if the client is unfit to nominate a Representative, and includes a Substitute Decision Maker.  Substitute Decision Maker (guardian) is a legally appointed person such as a guardian to make decisions on behalf of a client in certain areas, for example Healthcare Decisions and Lifestyle Decisions, or a financial manager to make Financial Decisions. A Substitute Decision Maker should work with a client\u2019s informal support networks to support a client to build their decision-making capacity.  Substituted Judgement is a decision made by a Representative regarding a client who is unable to communicate their will and preferences, or when a client\u2019s will and preferences infringe on their rights or the rights of others. A Substituted Judgement is based on the client\u2019s previous expressed will and preferences or, if this is unknown, a Representative\u2019s interpretation of \u2018what the client would have wanted\u2019. Supporter is a person or organisation who is designated by the client or organisation to aid in the communication and development of the client\u2019s wishes regarding their care. Supporters may be required to aid in the decision-making process, however the ultimate decision-making power lies with the client. Procedures Choice Information strategies  Information in appropriate formats about the opportunities for client choice will be provided to clients at each major service point from intake to end of service. If clients have literacy or communication issues, then every effort should be made to ensure they understand their rights and opportunities in making decisions regarding services. The information is available in the following documents: \u2022 Consultation about HHC services \u2022 Care planning process \nDecision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy  \n3 | Page Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy _POL_V01_2209  \u2022 Review of Care Plan \u2022 Annual Survey \u2022 Advance care planning \u2022 Complaints  Support to make choices Clients will have the opportunity to make choices about their service in the following ways: \u2022 service delivery access - types of service available, the days and times a service can be accessed, frequency of attendance, the location, how the service is provided to ensure that it meets individual needs (particularly in terms of physical, cultural or communication needs)  \u2022 individual service planning - expressing preferences for the level or intensity of service, which other services are involved, the ways that personal goals will be achieved, how progress reviews are conducted, and decisions about changes or exiting the service  Hope Holistic Care actively supports service users to make choices in the way they use services: \u2022 follow-up on written information and specific assistance to clients who may experience cultural or language barriers, or who may need specialised advocacy or support to take full advantage of the opportunities, providing information in a range of mediums: written, pictorial, verbal.   Record keeping Hope Holistic Care documents all input from clients regarding their service preferences. This is recorded on the client\u2019s file.  Supported Decision making and Dignity of Risk Clients will be provided with access to the support necessary for them to make, communicate and participate in decisions regarding their life and care. Clients should be provided with a Chinese format of this policy and be supported to understand it.  Staff will receive information and training on the nature of capacity in decision-making and how to support client decision-making that upholds clients\u2019 rights.  Designating the role of Supporters and Representatives  Supporters and Representatives should be designated by or with the consent of the client, and their roles can be formalised into a written decision-making agreement.  To avoid conflicts of interest, Supporters and Representatives should preferably not be in a position where they have interests in Hope Holistic Care or any other service provider delivering services to the client, as this may compromise their role. Where this is unavoidable, the written supported decision-making agreement should include a declaration of any conflicts of interest if they exist, and specify how actual or potential conflicts will be managed.   Supported decision-making should occur in collaboration with informal support networks such as friends, family, peer support and independent advocates. This will help to create a natural safeguard for the client and prevent Supporters from making decisions which are not in the client\u2019s best interests.  \nDecision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy  \n4 | Page Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy _POL_V01_2209   Assessing client decision-making capacity Care workers will notify the Case Manager if there are concerns regarding a client\u2019s decision-making capacity. The Case Manager will assess the situation and discuss with the client and their carer/representative regarding decision making support processes. Suggestions may be made to refer the client to relevant and qualified assessors (e.g. Solicitor, GP, social worker etc) for an assessment to be made to determine the client\u2019s decision-making capacity.  Substituted Judgement If it is determined that the client is unfit to make a decision regarding their life, their will and preferences will be overridden, and a Substituted Judgement will be made by the authorised Representative. This is considered as a last resort. Clients will only receive a Substituted Judgement or have their will and preferences overridden if:  \u2022 They cannot understand any of the risks associated with their decisions; or \u2022 The proposed decision presents a threat to the wellbeing of the client or others.   Supporting decision-making The current or previously expressed will and preferences of the client will be respected and carried out unless they are unlawful, or compromise other rights such as their right to safety, or the rights of others. In the process of supporting a client\u2019s decision: 1. A client\u2019s will and preference should be respected and given effect;  If will and preference are not known: 2. The Representative(s) must make a decision on what the client would likely want, based on the information available; If it is not possible to determine what the client would likely want: 3. The Representative must act to preserve the client\u2019s human rights and make the least restrictive decisions regarding those rights. Where clients require assistance in the communication of their will and preference, the organisation will provide the appropriate tools and strategies for the client to express themselves. This may include use of pictures, assistive technology or language services. Staff will support and assist clients to understand the context and consequences of their decisions.  Staff will work proactively with clients to establish social histories, life-story work and care plans as documentation which might assist in future decision-making scenarios.   \nDecision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy  \n5 | Page Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy _POL_V01_2209  Dignity of risk Supporters will respect an individual\u2019s right to the dignity of risk and will not dissuade them from making a decision based on the associated risks alone, whether real or perceived. If a client\u2019s decision involves some level of risk, Supporters should ensure that the client can foresee and understand the risks associated with the decision. Staff will attempt to manage the risks associated with significant decisions, while not attempting to change the client\u2019s mind regarding a decision. Process for dealing with perceived conflict of interest If a staff member or person from a client\u2019s support network believes a Representative or Supporter is not acting in the best interests of a client, they are to notify the Home Care Manager as soon as possible. Following a complaint in relation to an assisted decision, the Home Care Manager will assess whether the Representative or Supporter\u2019s vested interest in the decision influenced their actions. If it is found that the Supporter or Representative had a vested interest in a decision and the decision made was not in the best interests of the client, they will be removed as a Supporter or Representative.  If required, matters involving the abuse of Representative decision-making may be referred to the Guardianship tribunal or the Police or a relevant external body, depending on the situation. Documentation For Substituted Judgements that may have significant immediate and long-term consequences, the decision-making process and outcome will be documented and will be stored in the client\u2019s case file.

It is particularly common for older Australians living in aged care facilities to experience falls.    Hope Holistic Care (HHC) is committed to taking necessary measures to prevent falls and fall-related harm from occurring in our facilities. We will ensure appropriate falls assessment, prevention and management strategies are effectively implemented. We will also ensure that workers are adequately trained on how to assess, identify and mitigate falls.  Definitions Syncope (fainting): is a temporary loss of consciousness, often related to insufficient blood flow to the brain. Most commonly occurring when blood pressure is too low, and the heart doesn\u2019t pump enough oxygen to the brain.  Polypharmacy: is the concurrent use of multiple medications by a patient.  Vestibular dysfunction: is a common cause of dizziness among the older population.  Continence: is the ability of a person to control bowel and bladder movements.  Procedures Risk Screening and Assessment HHC will conduct a screening and assessment of all clients in our facilities upon arrival and every six months. This falls risk screening process will be undertaken by a Registered Nurse and will include the following assessment from the best practice guidelines, to determine if the resident is a high or low falls risk. After determining the risk category of each client, an individualised management plan will be developed by Registered staff which outlines the main falls risks and mitigations strategies. The management plan will be used so that all staff are aware of the risks posed to each individual client, and any additional environmental or medical strategies which may need to be implemented.  Syncope (fainting) All clients will be assessed for syncope on arrival at the facility. Presyncope, syncope and postural hypotension will be included when developing the client\u2019s management plan for falls prevention. The root causes of clients who report having unexplained falls or episodes will be identified and addressed. Dizziness and vertigo Clients will be assessed for vestibular dysfunction if they experience dizziness, vertigo or imbalance. Vestibular rehabilitation will be implemented to treat dizziness and balance problems where indicated.   \nFalls Prevention and Management Policy  \n2 | Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203  Vision Clients will receive an eye examination on arrival to determine if they have cataracts. Clients who have severe visual impairments will receive visual aids if necessary, and their environment will be modified accordingly. \n Client participation HHC will ensure that clients are involved during the falls prevention processes. We will: \u2022 provide information which frames falls prevention as a means for clients to remain independent for longer; \u2022 provide information on \u2018falls prevention\u2019 to clients in a manner they understand; \u2022 seek client input in discussions about preventing falls; \u2022 develop falls prevention programs which accommodate the individual client\u2019s needs; and \u2022 identify potential barriers the client may face when taking part in actions to prevent falls.  Staff training HHC\u2019s Registered staff will be trained on how to undertake screening and assessment of new clients to determine if they are a high or low falls risk. The Registered staff will be trained on how to identify potential barriers or hazards which could result in falls and injury. The care staff responsible for assisting clients who wear hip-protectors will undertake relevant training on the correct application of hip protectors. \n\nFalls Prevention and Management Policy  \n3 | Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203  Management Strategies Feet and footwear Clients\u2019 footwear will be reviewed regularly to ensure it meets the safety guidelines. Clients will be encouraged to wear soft soled shoes as opposed to slippers. Clients will also be encouraged to wear footwear when walking, to avoid the increased risk of falling barefoot. The facility will, where possible, provide grip socks to all clients who present a high falls risk, to wear during the night. Clients will be offerreded to be referred to a podiatrist on arrival if they present with foot issues which require specialised attention, who may assist in falls prevention. Environmental considerations HHC will monitor the client\u2019s environment and be attentive to feedback concerning near misses and recommend mitigation strategies where fall risks are identified, including to report to My Aged Care for reassessment to get assistance with Home modifications. Minimising injuries from falls Hip protectors will be given to clients who require them. HHC will consider the clients\u2019 falls history, mobility, steadiness, gait, disability status, osteoporosis and body index when deciding whether to use hip-protectors. HHC will also ensure that clients who require assistance to use hip-protectors receive the necessary support.  Restraints HHC will not apply restraints at anytime or under any circumstances. If a staff member is at risk of harm, they are advised to exit the client\u2019s home to a safe place before reporting to the Case manager of office personnel. Observation HHC will work with the client and/or their representative to ensure that higher falls risk clients are closely observed, such as via regular phone calls. Clients with dementia and other clients who have a high risk of falling, will be encouraged to apply devices which can detect their falls and send responses to designated contacts. Continence Clients will also be offered continence assessments to check if they have problems that can be modified or prevented. Improving balance with mobility and exercise HHC will develop tailored physical activity and exercise programs for clients to help strengthen and improve stability, strength and mobility.  HHC will assess balance, strength and mobility through a variety of tools and tests. These tests may include: - functional reach - six-metre walk - timed up-and-go - sit-to-stand  - spring balance  \nFalls Prevention and Management Policy  \n4 | Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203  Medication management Case managers, Registered Staff and Care workers should be aware of the medications each client is taking and how those medications effect whether they are a high or low risk patient (e.g. knowing antidepressants are associated with higher risk of falls).  HHC will encourage all clients who experience a fall have their medications reviewed by a pharmacist.

	"policy_name_Guidelines for Salary Packaging GDL_V02_2110": " \nGuidelines for Salary Packaging  \n \n   \n1 | P a g e  \nGuidelines for Salary Packaging GDL_V02_2110   \nBackground  \nHope Holistic Care (HHC) is an ACNC approved charity and public benevolent institution (PBI).  We can \noffer our employees salary packaging, an ATO -approved benefit whom can take advantage of the tax \nsavings.  \nWho can have salary packaging?  \nAll HHC employees, including permanent full time, part time and casuals  are entitled to have salary \npackaging .  \nHow does salary packaging work?  \nBy choosing to salary package, you allocate a portion of your income to the payment of certain expenses \nbefore your income tax is calculated. The part of your income that you allocate to salary packaging can be \nused for the same everyday items you pay for today, such as : \n- rent or mortgage payments  \n- credit card and personal loan repayments  \n- expenses via the Everyday P urchases Card  \n- school fees and much more  \nBecause you only pay tax on the remaining amount, you pay less tax and increase your take home pay.  \nEven if you have a HELP/HECS debt you could benefit from salary packaging.  \nHow much salary can you  packag e annual ly? \nSalary packaging limits are set for a Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT) year.  \nThe FBT year runs from 1 April to 31 March, you can salary package up to $15,900 each Fringe Benefit Tax \n(FBT) year or $611.53 per fortnight f or general living expenses.

This policy intends to ensure that where Hope Holistic Care is responsible for providing a client with assistance in managing their money or making a purchase, that this is done in an honest and accountable manner, and in the best interests of the client. Definitions Financial abuse: any act which involves misusing the money or property of a vulnerable person without their full knowledge and consent. This includes theft of money, pension cheques or property as well as misuse of a power of attorney. Procedures Scope This policy applies to all staff and volunteers of Hope Holistic Care who are directly or indirectly responsible for assisting clients to manage their personal finances. \u2022 Assistance includes o Personal banking  o Making cash or credit card purchases   Promoting autonomy Clients should manage their own funds wherever possible. Staff and volunteers should not manage or make decisions regarding clients\u2019 funds where clients are capable of doing so themselves.  Responsibility for assisting a client with money handling should only be assumed by staff and volunteers when the client or their authorised representative has requested and consented to receiving this assistance from Hope Holistic Care. Assistance, where required, should promote autonomy and choice, and enhance the client\u2019s independence.  Client consent Where assistance in managing financial affairs is required, a Consent Form must be obtained from the client and retained on their file. Clients\u2019 money may only be used for the purposes intended by the client.   Client cash It is important for clients to have ready access to their own cash to purchase personal items and for day-to-day expenses which are for the direct benefit of the client. Clients will usually withdraw cash from their personal savings accounts for this purpose. There may be other arrangements by which clients gain access to personal spending money. Clients will be permitted choice to decide how much assistance they require with their cash. Some clients will choose to retain control with minimal assistance, while others will rely on staff.  When making purchases for a client, staff members must keep all receipts as proof of purchase.  \nClient Money Management Procedure  \n2 | Page Client Money Management Policy_POL_V01_2209  On completion of shopping, details of the purchase made and the change received are to be recorded in the Money Handling record in Knack. The client will sign the record electronically on the staff\u2019s phone. Client Credit Card access, PayWave and PayPass Under no circumstances are staff permitted to have access to client\u2019s PIN numbers Client\u2019s may request that staff can use PayWave or PayPass to attend their shopping and payment of bills. Staff must ensure: \u2022 The care plan clearly documents that the client authorises staff to use their bank card for PayWave/PayPass purchases and payments \u2022 Payments are within the amount specified by the bank \u2022 They provide the client with a receipt of all purchases and payments where PayWave/PayPass has been used  Care staff and volunteers are to report to the Case Manager immediately if the client\u2019s card has been lost or stolen. The Case Manager must inform the client and/or appropriate representatives and assist with cancelling the card if required.  Operating rules for staff and volunteers Staff and volunteers must: \u2022 ensure that clients\u2019 funds are used only for the benefit of that client; \u2022 ensure that receipts are obtained for all items purchased when accompanying a client; \u2022 encourage clients to plan for purchases and discourage clients from carrying large amounts of cash; \u2022 maintain an electronic record all cash issued and spent; \u2022 report if an amount of greater than $200 is transacted; and \u2022 report any discrepancies to their supervisor. Staff and volunteers must not: \u2022 make a personal purchase with money from a client\u2019s funds; \u2022 borrow money from any client; \u2022 pay for a client expense with the staff member\u2019s own finances; \u2022 give clients investment advice; \u2022 be a signatory or witness to any signing of documentation \u2022 transfer petty cash between clients.  Gifts and Purchases Any sales transactions between a client and an HHC staff member should be disclosed to their manager prior to the transaction. Approval must be given by the staff member\u2019s manager. Any money or gifts of any value cannot be accepted by employees.  If a client or relative wishes to make a personal gift, care staff is to advise them that donations may be made to HHC directly.  \nClient Money Management Procedure  \n3 | Page Client Money Management Policy_POL_V01_2209  Responsibilities of Office staff Office staff must: \u2022 Immediately report any alerts of missing signatures or large amounts of cash handled (>$100) to the Chief Financial Officer for further investigation.

This policy will be reviewed and updated by the Home Care Manager annually to ensure it is up to date with relevant legislation, standards and is responsive to feedback.           \n",
	"policy_name_HHC Staff Handbook 2312": " \n       HHC Care Staff Handbook   Welcome Thank you for joining Hope Holistic Care.

We look forward to you starting with us and may you find the journey meaningful and fulfilling.  \u201cAnd now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.\u201d 1 Corinthians 13:13  Our Vision, Mission and Values Hope Holistic Care wants to build a community for older people to share eternal hope.  A community comprises of clients, families, staff, health professionals and community service providers.

Where this isn\u2019t possible, we rely on grace and mercy, having a focus on our client\u2019s outcomes. \nStaff Handbook  \n1 | Page Staff Handbook  Orientation When you first join us, we will send you information about standard practices and setup communication systems, including information technology. We will introduce you to our team of staff via a social app. If you have any questions, you will be able to contact a member of our office team. Scheduling availability and requests We will ask you when you are available to work. We will generally assign clients that fit your availability. We ask that we work together to find the best possible outcome for the client.  We know that things change, so we will ask that you update your availability with us on a regular basis. Please let us know of changes at least 2 weeks or more in advance. Assigning client services When a client service is assigned to you, our office team will give you some background on the client so that you know what to expect. You will find the client\u2019s care plan in the app for more information. If you are replacing someone on a shift, we will also provide a handover to help the client experience a seamless service. To find out more about what how to be successful in delivering services to our clients, please refer to the Things to be mindful of section. After the service, we will contact you to discuss how you went. We will also contact the client so that we can resolve any issues quickly to ensure positive experiences in future visits.

You contact your manager directly, ring 02 7228 1369 or email info@hopehc.org.au to talk to us. If you want to provide anonymous feedback, you can do so by sending us a letter to our office.  Code of Conduct for aged care and Ethical Behaviour Older people depend on us in varying capacities to maintain their well-being and live a quality life. We have the power to help them. Therefore, we need to be mindful to use our abilities to support older people and protect them from harm. We would do well to: 1. Act with respect for individual rights to freedom of expression, self-determination, and decision-making in accordance with relevant laws and conventions 2. Act in a way that treats people with dignity and respect, and values their diversity 3. Respect the privacy of everyone 4. Provide services in a safe and competent manner with care and skill 5. Act with integrity, honesty, and transparency 6. Promptly take steps to raise and act on concerns about matters that might have an impact on the quality and safety of services provided to people who are vulnerable 7. Provide care, supports and services free from: (i) all forms of violence, discrimination, exploitation, neglect and abuse (ii) sexual misconduct 8. Take all reasonable steps to prevent and respond to all forms of violence, exploitation, neglect, and abuse of people in our care \nStaff Handbook  \n2 | Page Staff Handbook  You can find out more about these behaviours in our Code of Ethical Conduct Policy \u201cDear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.\u201d 1 John 4:11 Things to be mindful of Confidentiality Often, we will learn things about clients other people will not know, either through conversations or reading documents. We need to remember to protect their confidentiality, and only share information to those who are also involved with their care. Before sharing any information, think about why you are sharing it. If it is necessary, be mindful to share only what needs to be known for that purpose. Also, think about whether you would like others talking about you in the same way. This applies to our colleagues and company information as well. Remember that we entrust each other with our information so that we can help meet each other\u2019s needs.  \u201cDo not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen.\u201d  Ephesians 4:29  If you want to know more about this subject, you can access our Privacy Policy or talk to your manager about it. Safety, Security and Abuse When clients open their home to us, they are giving us a lot of power. We need to be mindful of this and use it responsibly. In everything we do or say, it\u2019s important that we do so safely, as well as making them feel safe and secure. Abuse can occur when we come across as threatening, disrespectful; when we ignore their needs; when we touch them inappropriately; when we use physical force, or take advantage of their belongings, such as money. It is best that we treat our clients and colleagues with respect and humility. We need to show our concern for them by asking them if they feel safe and take actions if they say otherwise. \u201cDo not devise harm against your neighbour, while he lives securely beside you.\u201d Proverbs 3:29  If you want to find out more, you can refer to our Abuse and Neglect Policy or talk to your manager about it. Appearance Appearance can affect the comfort of clients we serve as well as what they think of the organisation. Therefore, we should always dress appropriately, being presentable, professional, clean, neat and tidy. All Care staff will be supplied with at least one HHC uniform shirt by the Office. Please use it and wash regularly. Appearance Guidelines Please follow the below guidelines: \u2022 Identification badges should be worn to let clients know your name \nStaff Handbook  \n3 | Page Staff Handbook  \u2022 In general, shoes should be sturdy, low heeled, protect the foot and have slip-resistant soles. We will wear shoe covers when we enter client\u2019s homes. \u2022 Uniforms are expected to be clean, tidy and not appear scrunched up. Hair When providing direct care, please tie your hair back if it is longer than shoulder length for hygiene purposes. Personal Items We should only be bringing what we need into the house. Consider bringing a small bag and keep it near the entrance of the home. This is to prevent suspicions of theft by the client. Try not to bring many personal items into the residence.  Jewellery/Nails For safety purposes, when providing care, we should not wear rings (other than wedding bands), bracelets (other than medical alert bracelets), very long fingernails, nail polish, drop earrings and necklaces. Ear studs may be worn. This is to preserve the skin integrity of our clients and prevent unnecessary injury. Mobile phones We should generally refrain from using our mobile phones for personal reasons when working with a client. It is best to be kept in your bag so that you can pay attention to the client. If you are expecting an important call, notify the client in advance and minimise the time spent on the call. Smoking For the health and safety of our clients and colleagues, all working environments, including the client\u2019s house and surrounds, are smoke-free. We encourage all staff to refrain from smoking whilst on shift and/or whilst travelling between clients. Hygiene and Infection Control Our clients can get very sick if they are infected with viruses or bacteria into their home. For the safety of them and us, we should keep ourselves clean and use personal protective equipment at appropriate times. This includes regular hand sanitisation, mask and glove wearing. You should always have these supplies with you. If you need to replenish them, please contact the office and we will arrange to deliver these to you. Please read the Infection Prevention and Control Policy and talk to your manager if you have any questions. Work Health and Safety Your health and safety are important to HHC. HHC is committed to the following: \u2022 Regularly talk to you and ask you about work health and safety \u2022 Develop safe procedures for everyone to use every day, including for emergencies \u2022 Provide reporting systems and injury management What we need you to do is to: \u2022 Use of the Home Safety Checklist at the client\u2019s home before services start \u2022 Take care for the safety of yourself and others \nStaff Handbook  \n4 | Page Staff Handbook  \u2022 Comply with health and safety directions \u2022 Report incidents and injury immediately \u2022 Report and control hazards as you identify them, and report to management as needed Learning and Development We learn by experience and seeking answers to questions that come up in what we do each day. Therefore, HHC will actively encourage individual staff to reflect on the clients and services to identify opportunities for learning. We also organise group education sessions on topics that have been raised through client needs, staff requests and as required by industry standards or legislation. Employee relations Probation For Permanent or full-time staff, we generally provide a probationary period of 3 months, unless there is written notice from us to indicate otherwise. Payroll Enquiries Hope Holistic Care operates on a fortnightly pay cycle.

Travel When visiting clients, the first trip to the client from your home and the last trip returning home will not be included in the mileage reimbursement. We will calculate the mileage for travel between the clients based on Google Maps and automatically pay you as travel allowance.

Unless specified, there will not be any reimbursement for tolls paid during the travel to clients\u2019 homes. Parking fines or any traffic infringements are not payable by HHC. Discrimination and Harassment Hope Holistic Care strives to maintain a working environment free from all forms of harassment or intimidation.

It is expected that people in our workplace will behave in accordance with our Code of Ethical Behaviour. All reports of harassment, victimisation and bullying will be taken seriously, managed promptly and be treated with sensitivity and confidentiality. \nStaff Handbook  \n5 | Page Staff Handbook  Responsibilities Everyone is responsible to create and maintain a workplace environment that is free from any form of harassment. Managers and Supervisors Managers and supervisors must ensure that acceptable standards of behaviour are maintained in the workplace and have communicated the message that harassment will not be tolerated within the workplace.

We encourage all employees to take responsibility for raising issues in a constructive way that will allow the organisation to acknowledge and take appropriate action. Any employee who believes that they have been unfairly treated, has the right to discuss the issue with their manager. Every manager within the organisation who has a grievance brought to their attention has the following obligations: \u2022 To take the matter seriously \u2022 To record the conversation and any agreed outcome \u2022 To refer the matter to an appropriate person who can help the manager and employee resolve the issue In extreme circumstances, Hope Holistic Care may seek the assistance of an external qualified grievance management body to assist in resolving the matter. \nStaff Handbook  \n6 | Page Staff Handbook  A grievance should be lodged in writing and must identify the nature of the grievance, all of the persons involved, and the time and location in which the incident is reported to have arisen. Anonymous grievances will not be pursued by Hope Holistic Care. Senior management will treat all issues fairly, confidentially and without repercussions. False allegations are considered by Hope Holistic Care to be deliberate and wilful misconduct. Performance Management and Disciplinary Action The purpose of the performance management and disciplinary processes are to outline the steps that are required to be taken in order to resolve a performance management issue or a breach of terms and conditions of employment or organisation policy. This procedure is used to: \u2022 Ensure fair treatment of staff at all times \u2022 Establish a consistent approach to handling disciplinary matters \u2022 Ensure that staff effort is channelled in the right direction \u2022 Bring about a suitable change in any undesirable conduct/performance \u2022 Prevent a situation of consistently unsatisfactory conduct/performance arising  The purpose of counselling is to advise the staff member of any performance/conduct of concern and to establish if the organisation can provide assistance to avoid further instances of unacceptable performance/ conduct, whether through training, coaching or some other action.

Exploitation often occurs with vulnerable groups such as people with a disability and older people. Exploitation is a form of abuse. Abuse: is any form of violence, coercion, exploitation, discrimination, harm or neglect which causes another person psychological or physical pain or suffering. Abuse can be emotional, physical, financial, chemical or sexual. Procedures Assessing risks of abuse: Workers will be trained to identify and respond to factors which may heighten the risk of clients being a victim of abuse. Workers will consider, for each client, the factors that can contribute to client vulnerability, such as social and geographical isolation, insecure accommodation, dependency on carers, not having the means or capacity to advocate for themselves, fragility and dysfunctional family lives.  Preventing abuse Organisational commitment to prevention Hope Holistic Care has preventative measures in place to ensure that individuals are free from discrimination, exploitation, abuse, harm, neglect and violence.

Barriers to both client and worker disclosure of incidents of abuse will be addressed and mitigated. Hope Holistic Care will develop clear Whistleblower protections to encourage transparency and prevent abuse from going unreported. Refer to Policy: Whistleblower protection Feedback  Hope Holistic Care will ensure there are adequate feedback and complaints mechanisms in place and all clients are aware of how to lodge a complaint or provide feedback.

Following an incident, HHC\u2019s investigation and resolution processes are outcomes-focused and conducted in line with the principles of Open Disclosure. HHC is committed to ensuring that all incidents and near misses which occur in relation to the provision of services are managed consistently and effectively, and that workers can identify, manage, report and resolve incidents. The organisation collects and reviews data on incidents in order to inform improvement activities. HHC regularly reviews its incident management system and processes to ensure that they are: Well documented; Readily accessible to all workers employed or engaged by the organisation; Reflective and adaptive, with an intent to prevent incidents; and Compliant with the Serious Incident Response Scheme. Definitions Commission refers to the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission Incidents are acts, omissions, events or circumstances that occur or could occur during or in relation to the provision of care and services, or the alteration or withdrawal of care and services, that cause harm, either physically or emotionally, to a worker, consumer, or other stakeholder. Incidents also include acts, omissions, events or circumstances that have caused or could cause damage to property, the environment, material or cause public alarm. Reportable incidents are alleged, suspected or actual incidents which have occurred in connection with service delivery, where the person affected by the incident is a consumer, of severity that must be reported to the Commission. This includes but is not limited to: \u2022 Unexpected death; \u2022 Unexplained absence; \u2022 Unreasonable use of force; \u2022 Psychological or emotional abuse; \u2022 Neglect; \u2022 Unlawful or inappropriate sexual contact; \u2022 Stealing or financial coercion by a staff member; and \u2022 Inappropriate physical or chemical restraint. Priority 1 incidents are Reportable Incidents of a higher level of harm than Priority 2 incidents and must be reported to the Commission within a more immediate timeframe. Priority 1 incidents include: \u2022 Physical or psychological injury or illness requiring onsite medical or psychological treatment to resolve; \u2022 Incidents where there are reasonable grounds to report the incident to police; or \nIncident Management Policy  \n2 | Page Incident Management Policy _POL_V01_2203  \u2022 A consumer\u2019s unexpected death or a consumer\u2019s unexplained absence from the service. All \u2018Priority 1\u2019 incidents must be reported to the Commission within 24 hours. Priority 2 incidents are Reportable Incidents which are not Priority 1 incidents, and which result in a lower level of harm to a consumer, which must be reported to the Commission within 30 days of the incident occurring.  All \u2018Priority 2\u2019 incidents must be reported to the Commission within 30 days. Workers are staff, contractors and volunteers employed or engaged by HHC  Procedures Induction and staff training All workers must be familiar with the organisation\u2019s incident management system, understand the organisation\u2019s definition of Reportable Incidents, Priority 1 and Priority 2 incidents, and understand the procedures they must follow for reporting all incidents to the organisation and the Commission (if required).  HHC promotes a culture of open reporting and ensures that all workers understand that they are supported to report any incident or alleged incident, and that there will be no negative consequences for doing so. Incident identification If a worker observes an incident, or a consumer or member of the public notifies a worker about an incident that does or could cause permanent or temporary detriment to a consumer, worker or other stakeholder, then the worker must report the incident to the Home Care Manager.  Workers and consumers will be protected against any adverse actions as a result of reporting or alleging that an incident has occurred. Immediate response, and risk mitigation Where possible, an incident will first be addressed by the organisation\u2019s personnel responsible and qualified to effectively manage the incident as it takes place. First responders understand that they must contact emergency services if the situation warrants. The principle is reduce harm, reduce risks and provide support. \u2022 Reduce harm as much as possible (First aid) \u2022 Reduce risks e.g. consider providing paid leave to distressed workers \u2022 Provide support to those affected. Notification procedures Staff must report incidents to various agencies and persons based on the following priority system: \u2022 For incidents of a serious nature workers must first contact emergency services. \u2022 Workers must report all incidents and near misses internally to the Home Care Manager \u2022 If it is determined that the incident is a Reportable Incident, the Home Care Manager is responsible for notifying families, guardians and advocates of the consumer.  \nIncident Management Policy  \n3 | Page Incident Management Policy _POL_V01_2203  \u2022 If an incident is a Reportable Incident, the Home Care Manager will determine whether it is a Priority 1 or Priority 2 incident (with the help of the Commission\u2019s Decision Support Tool), and notify the Commission within the expected timeframe of the Commission. Reporting will be done through the My Aged Care Provider Portal. External Reporting 1) Police If HHC becomes aware of a Reportable Incident of a serious nature, it will be reported to police. This includes in cases: \u2022 In which a Reportable Incident is only suspected or alleged to have occurred; \u2022 Where there are reasonable grounds to notify police; or \u2022 Where the Reportable Incident is criminal in nature.  HHC will notify the consumer and/or their representative if an incident has been reported to the police. 2) Commission - Timeframes Unexplained absence from care will first be reported to the police, then to the Commission as soon as possible, and not later than 24 hours after the absence was reported to the police. All Priority 1 incidents will be reported, at a minimum, to the Commission in a two-stage process: \u2022 Within 24 hours: incident notification to the Commission and reporting to police where necessary; and \u2022 Within 5 business days: incident status report. All Priority 2 incidents will be reported to the Commission within 30 days of HHC either suspecting or becoming aware of the actual incident. HHC will respond promptly to any further questions from the Commission, and provide a final report if required by the Commission. If required by the Commission, a final report will be provided within 84 business days. The final report will include findings from investigative processes, as well as any additional details required by the Commission. If significant new information comes to light in relation to a Reportable Incident which has already been reported to the Commission, the Home Care Manager is responsible for informing the Commission as soon as possible, using the Commission-approved form.  3) Consider other Legislated/Mandatory Reporting requirements \u2022 Practitioner Conduct: These may include legislated \u2018mandatory reporting\u2019 to AHPRA if there is concern about conduct regarding registered practitioners (see AHPRA guidance). NB consideration should be given for voluntary reports based on the nature of the incident to allow AHPRA to investigate. \u2022 Privacy/Confidentiality: o Consider if this represents a \u2018Notifiable Data Breach\u2019 for organisations where turnover >$3million. o For more information see \u2018 \u2022 Mandatory notifications for Workplace Injury include: o The death of a person o a \u2018serious injury or illness\u2019, or \nIncident Management Policy  \n4 | Page Incident Management Policy _POL_V01_2203  o a \u2018dangerous incident \u00a7 See \u2018Incident notification information sheet\u2019 for more details and explanation of defintions and timeframes. \u2022 Insurer where relevant \u2022 Other o Consider the situation and other external notifications that may be required. Supporting consumers Throughout the incident management process, from initial response through to review, consumers and others affected by an incident will be supported by the organisation through means of: \u2022 Open Disclosure. The principles of incident management include where safe and appropriate to as much as possible advisie the consumer, following the principles of Open Disclosure.

Consumers and others affected by an incident will be involved in the management and resolution of the incident where appropriate. Consumers and other stakeholders will be informed of HHC\u2019s incident management system, and will have access to this policy. Assessment and investigation The Home Care Manager is responsible for creating an initial assessment of any incident, to determine the severity of an incident and to establish the need for, and scope of, an investigation. If an incident is a Reportable Incident, an internal investigation will take place. All investigations will be undertaken and conducted in accordance with principles of natural justice and procedural fairness. Incidents involving criminal allegations will be reported to law enforcement, who will receive full support of the organisation in their investigations. Whenever an investigation into an incident is conducted, it should establish: \u2022 The cause of the incident; \u2022 The effect of the incident; \u2022 Any organisational processes that contributed to or did not function in preventing the incident; \u2022 Changes the organisation can make to prevent further incidents from occurring; \u2022 What, if any, remedial action must be undertaken to prevent or minimise future incidents; and \u2022 The effectiveness of HHC \u2018s incident management system in relation to the incident. Information related to incident investigations, including records of phone conversations, emails, documents and, where possible, records of face-to-face interviews will be recorded and kept in strict confidence. \nIncident Management Policy  \n5 | Page Incident Management Policy _POL_V01_2203  Risk ratings table Risk Rating/ Response time Type of Incidents Low (7 Days) \u2022 One-off incident - not recurring \u2022 Incidents where nobody was or was potentially physically or psychologically harmed \u2022 Any injuries / illnesses which were very minor \u2013 band aid or Panadol was enough to remedy \u2022 There was no significant damage to property Medium (48 ours) \u2022 A one-off incident which identified an ongoing hazard needing urgent remedy; e.g. client injured by incident with wheelchair needing repair / broken shower chair \u2022 A recurring incident involving the same client or the same LSW (even if at the lower end of seriousness).
