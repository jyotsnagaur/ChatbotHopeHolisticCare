Healthcare Associated Infections (HAIs) are a major cause of poor patient outcomes, and a significant proportion of infections can be prevented if infection control practices are developed, implemented and adhered to. This Infection Control Policy will seek to minimise the risk of infection for: • Persons receiving services • Persons employed or engaged by HHC Hope Holistic Care will adhere to the following principles in relation to infection prevention and control: • Infection control will be a component of Hope Holistic Care’s overall risk management framework • Hope Holistic Care will include organisation-wide involvement in all aspects of this Policy • Hope Holistic Care will make infection prevention and control an item on clinical governance committees Procedures Preparing Staff Hope Holistic Care will ensure that staff members: • Receive training and supervision related to infection prevention and control procedures; • Can identify and assess infection control risks; • Plan and prepare for identified risks, including communication to clients or staff; • Always act with caution and use protective barriers or personal protective equipment; • Understand the importance of hand care and hand washing; • Follow procedures regarding the use of needles and sharp objects; and • Review each client-related incident that involves actual or potential risk from passing on infections, and use this to inform policy and practice in the future. Responsibilities: Hope Holistic Care will: • Establish local governance systems for Infection Prevention and Control; • Ensure Infection Control Policies are implemented. Hope Holistic Care’s Managers will: • Ensure the necessary tools and resources are provided to Infection prevention and control worker training for them to be able to implement Hope Holistic Care’s Infection Control Infection Prevention and Control Policy _POL_V01_2209 1|Page Infection Prevention and Control Policy management policy; • Conduct surveillance and audit programs to monitor key infection rates and process measures; and • Identify risks that apply through surveillance data and implement strategies to mitigate such risks. Hope Holistic Care’s Infection prevention and control coordinators will: • Develop an infection management plan in line with national and state guidelines to minimise the occurrence and impact of Healthcare associated Infections (HAI); • Ensure adequately trained workers are responsible for the surveillance of hand hygiene compliance data; • Contribute to the formulation of consensus practice guidelines; and • Ensure education and training on infection control and prevention is provided to all workers as part of induction. Hope Holistic Care’s Healthcare facility workers: • Understand the requirements of infection prevention and control; • Adhere to state and local policies and procedures on infection control at all times; and • Undergo the required training and competency assessment in infection prevention and control procedures.

    "incident = \"Policy HHC’s incident management system is consumer-centred, and focuses on the health, safety, wellbeing, and quality of life of consumers and anyone affected by an incident. Following an incident, HHC’s investigation and resolution processes are outcomes-focused and conducted in line with the principles of Open Disclosure. HHC is committed to ensuring that all incidents and near misses which occur in relation to the provision of services are managed consistently and effectively, and that workers can identify, manage, report and resolve incidents. The organisation collects and reviews data on incidents in order to inform improvement activities. HHC regularly reviews its incident management system and processes to ensure that they are: Well documented; Readily accessible to all workers employed or engaged by the organisation; Reflective and adaptive, with an intent to prevent incidents; and Compliant with the Serious Incident Response Scheme. Definitions Commission Incidents Reportable incidents refers to the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission are acts, omissions, events or circumstances that occur or could occur during or in relation to the provision of care and services, or the alteration or withdrawal of care and services, that cause harm, either physically or emotionally, to a worker, consumer, or other stakeholder. Incidents also include acts, omissions, events or circumstances that have caused or could cause damage to property, the environment, material or cause public alarm. are alleged, suspected or actual incidents which have occurred in connection with service delivery, where the person affected by the incident is a consumer, of severity that must be reported to the Commission. This includes but is not limited to: • Unexpected death; • Unexplained absence; • Unreasonable use of force; • Psychological or emotional abuse; • Neglect; • Unlawful or inappropriate sexual contact; • Stealing or financial coercion by a staff member; and • Inappropriate physical or chemical restraint. are Reportable Incidents of a higher level of harm than Priority 2 incidents and must be reported to the Commission within a more immediate timeframe. Priority 1 incidents include: • Physical or psychological injury or illness requiring onsite medical or psychological treatment to resolve; • Incidents where there are reasonable grounds to report the incident to police; or Priority 1 incidents Incident Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 1|Page Incident Management Policy Priority 2 incidents Workers Procedures • A consumer’s unexpected death or a consumer’s unexplained absence from the service. All ‘Priority 1’ incidents must be reported to the Commission within 24 hours. are Reportable Incidents which are not Priority 1 incidents, and which result in a lower level of harm to a consumer, which must be reported to the Commission within 30 days of the incident occurring. All ‘Priority 2’ incidents must be reported to the Commission within 30 days. are staff, contractors and volunteers employed or engaged by HHC Induction and staff training All workers must be familiar with the organisation’s incident management system, understand the organisation’s definition of Reportable Incidents, Priority 1 and Priority 2 incidents, and understand the procedures they must follow for reporting all incidents to the organisation and the Commission (if required). HHC promotes a culture of open reporting and ensures that all workers understand that they are supported to report any incident or alleged incident, and that there will be no negative consequences for doing so. Incident identification If a worker observes an incident, or a consumer or member of the public notifies a worker about an incident that does or could cause permanent or temporary detriment to a consumer, worker or other stakeholder, then the worker must report the incident to the Home Care Manager. Workers and consumers will be protected against any adverse actions as a result of reporting or alleging that an incident has occurred. Immediate response, and risk mitigation Where possible, an incident will first be addressed by the organisation’s personnel responsible and qualified to effectively manage the incident as it takes place. First responders understand that they must contact emergency services if the situation warrants. The principle is reduce harm, reduce risks and provide support. • Reduce harm as much as possible (First aid) • Reduce risks e.g. consider providing paid leave to distressed workers • Provide support to those affected. Notification procedures Staff must report incidents to various agencies and persons based on the following priority system: • For incidents of a serious nature workers must first contact emergency services. • Workers must report all incidents and near misses internally to the Home Care Manager • If it is determined that the incident is a Reportable Incident, the Home Care Manager is responsible for notifying families, guardians and advocates of the consumer. Incident Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 2|Page Incident Management Policy • If an incident is a Reportable Incident, the Home Care Manager will determine whether it is a Priority 1 or Priority 2 incident (with the help of the Commission’s Decision Support Tool), and notify the Commission within the expected timeframe of the Commission. Reporting will be done through the My Aged Care Provider Portal. External Reporting 1) Police If HHC becomes aware of a Reportable Incident of a serious nature, it will be reported to police. This includes in cases: • In which a Reportable Incident is only suspected or alleged to have occurred; • Where there are reasonable grounds to notify police; or • Where the Reportable Incident is criminal in nature. HHC will notify the consumer and/or their representative if an incident has been reported to the police. 2) Commission - Timeframes Unexplained absence from care will first be reported to the police, then to the Commission as soon as possible, and not later than 24 hours after the absence was reported to the police. All Priority 1 incidents will be reported, at a minimum, to the Commission in a two-stage process: • Within 24 hours: incident notification to the Commission and reporting to police where necessary; and • Within 5 business days: incident status report. All Priority 2 incidents will be reported to the Commission within 30 days of HHC either suspecting or becoming aware of the actual incident. HHC will respond promptly to any further questions from the Commission, and provide a final report if required by the Commission. If required by the Commission, a final report will be provided within 84 business days. The final report will include findings from investigative processes, as well as any additional details required by the Commission. If significant new information comes to light in relation to a Reportable Incident which has already been reported to the Commission, the Home Care Manager is responsible for informing the Commission as soon as possible, using the Commission-approved form. 3) Consider other Legislated/Mandatory Reporting requirements • Practitioner Conduct: These may include legislated ‘mandatory reporting’ to AHPRA if there is concern about conduct regarding registered practitioners (see AHPRA guidance). NB consideration should be given for voluntary reports based on the nature of the incident to allow AHPRA to investigate. • Privacy/Confidentiality: o Considerifthisrepresentsa‘NotifiableDataBreach’fororganisationswhere turnover >$3million. o Formoreinformationsee‘ • Mandatory notifications for Workplace Injury include: o Thedeathofaperson o a‘seriousinjuryorillness’,or Incident Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 3|Page Incident Management Policy o a‘dangerousincident § See ‘Incident notification information sheet’ for more details and explanation of defintions and timeframes. • Insurer where relevant • Other o Considerthesituationandotherexternalnotificationsthatmayberequired. Supporting consumers Throughout the incident management process, from initial response through to review, consumers and others affected by an incident will be supported by the organisation through means of: • Open Disclosure. The principles of incident management include where safe and appropriate to as much as possible advisie the consumer, following the principles of Open Disclosure. The Clinical Excellence Commission, NSW, STARS framework (attached) is often useful. • Reassurance • Trauma and counselling services where required; • Changes to regular care and services if necessary; • Consistent engagement with consumers and others affected by an incident, in line with the principles of open disclosure; and • Clear, ongoing communication regarding the progress and outcomes of the investigation. Consumers and others affected by an incident will be involved in the management and resolution of the incident where appropriate. Consumers and other stakeholders will be informed of HHC’s incident management system, and will have access to this policy. Assessment and investigation The Home Care Manager is responsible for creating an initial assessment of any incident, to determine the severity of an incident and to establish the need for, and scope of, an investigation. If an incident is a Reportable Incident, an internal investigation will take place. All investigations will be undertaken and conducted in accordance with principles of natural justice and procedural fairness. Incidents involving criminal allegations will be reported to law enforcement, who will receive full support of the organisation in their investigations. Whenever an investigation into an incident is conducted, it should establish: • The cause of the incident; • The effect of the incident; • Any organisational processes that contributed to or did not function in preventing the incident; • Changes the organisation can make to prevent further incidents from occurring; • What, if any, remedial action must be undertaken to prevent or minimise future incidents; and • The effectiveness of HHC ‘s incident management system in relation to the incident. Information related to incident investigations, including records of phone conversations, emails, documents and, where possible, records of face-to-face interviews will be recorded and kept in strict confidence.

The organisation will inform and involve consumers, family and advocates in the process of incident management and resolution. The principles of open disclosure will be observed throughout the incident resolution process. Implementing and monitoring corrective actions The Home Care Manager is responsible for implementing corrective quality and safety processes based on the findings of an incident investigation. The Home Care Manager is responsible for monitoring the outcomes of corrective quality and safety measures on a quarterly basis. Incident Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 5|Page Incident Management Policy Incident register and review including Committee Oversight The organisation keeps an accurate register of all incidents that occur in relation to the provision of services. Each entry in the register contains: • A description of the incident; • A determination of whether or not the incident is a Reportable Incident; • For Reportable Incidents, a determination of the priority of the incident; • Where possible, time, date and location; • Time and date the incident was identified; • Names and contact details of all the people involved, including witnesses; • Names and contact details of the incident assessment; • Actions taken in regard to the incident; • Whether the persons affected by the incident have been provided with any reports or findings regarding the incident; • Where relevant, the details and outcomes of any investigation; and • The name and contact details of the person recording the incident. The organisation will also check/oversight and review incident management via relevant committees every quarter to understand trends, address systemic issues, provide feedback and training to staff about preventing and managing incidents, and inform improvement activities. Records will be kept for a minimum of seven years. Disclosures qualifying for protection In accordance with section 54-4 of the Aged Care Act Act 1997 (Cth), individuals can be entitled to protection if they report a Reportable Incident.

    "salary = \"Guidelines for Salary Packaging Background Hope Holistic Care (HHC) is an ACNC approved charity and public benevolent institution (PBI). We can offer our employees salary packaging, an ATO-approved benefit whom can take advantage of the tax savings. Who can have salary packaging? All HHC employees, including permanent full time, part time and casuals are entitled to have salary packaging. How does salary packaging work? By choosing to salary package, you allocate a portion of your income to the payment of certain expenses before your income tax is calculated. The part of your income that you allocate to salary packaging can be used for the same everyday items you pay for today, such as : - rent or mortgage payments - credit card and personal loan repayments - expenses via the Everyday Purchases Card - school fees and much more Because you only pay tax on the remaining amount, you pay less tax and increase your take home pay. Even if you have a HELP/HECS debt you could benefit from salary packaging. How much salary can you package annually? Salary packaging limits are set for a Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT) year. The FBT year runs from 1 April to 31 March, you can salary package up to $15,900 each Fringe Benefit Tax (FBT) year or $611.53 per fortnight for general living expenses. An additional benefit in your first year is that if you start salary packaging part way through the FBT year, you can still package the full annual amount between then and 31 March (we call this maximising).

This policy does not apply to grievances raised under the provisions of any applicable industrial instruments. 3 Definition A grievance is an unfair or unjust act or a wrongdoing that causes distress or notable discomfort to an employee or volunteer at work or within the work environment.

Sometimes people behave inappropriately without realising, or make decisions without considering the repercussions. Telling the person will give them the chance to stop or change what they are doing. The following steps should be followed for this step: a) If you have a grievance at work, do not ignore the problem. b) Speak to the person who you believe to be the cause of the grievance, explaining how you feel as soon as practicable after the problem has arisen. If the grievance is about their behaviour, tell them that it is not acceptable, it is offensive, unsuitable or hurtful. If it is about a work decision, tell them why you think it is unfair, inappropriate etc. c) Keep a diary note of the date and content of the discussion and if there were any witnesses present d) If the behaviour persists or if no agreement can be achieved, you are able to lodge a formal complaint as outlined below Should adopting an informal approach to resolving a grievance prove unsuccessful, or the matter is highly sensitive and not appropriate for an informal process, the following steps give guidance for managing a formal grievance: a) Notification- (making a complaint) You must notify, in writing or otherwise, the substance of the grievance and attempt to resolve it with your immediate Manager. The CEO may become involved depending on the situation. If the grievance is of a nature that you cannot notify your immediate Manager because it is not appropriate, you may notify the next reporting level up. For particularly difficult or sensitive grievances, where referral up to the next level is neither the appropriate or preferred avenue, you may refer the matter, in writing to, direct to the CEO. b) Investigation and reporting The grievance is investigated. Relevant material and information are sought, including information from other sources where appropriate. Documentation is complied. the length and formality of communication about the grievance will depend on the seriousness and complexity of the complaint, but should generally at this stage be minimal. Communication to those involved, should include Grievance Management Procedure_PRO_V01_2201 3|Page Grievance Management Procedure suggested actions/options to resolve the grievance or to provide guidance for referring the matter to the next level up or to the CEO as appropriate. All investigation and disciplinary processes conducted at HHC will be managed in accordance with the relevant Award and/or legislation, and principles of natural justice.

A written record will be made of formal investigation interviews and disciplinary meetings, and a copy will be made available to the employee as soon as practicable after the meeting. c) Action and record any outcome Solution available- A proposed solution is provided to you. If acceptable, it is implemented. If the solution affects other employees or volunteers, it must be notified to and agreed with them in advance. Solution not Immediately available- You and your Manager are to confer with a more Senior Manager. If the matter is still not resolved- If the matter is still not resolved, you may refer the matter for consideration of and resolution by the CEO.

Work must continue- Work must continue in the manner required while the grievance is being dealt with. The fact that work continues does not prejudice you or HHC. 6 Confidentiality At all times during the grievance procedure, management and the CEO will maintain confidentiality as far as possible.

Introduction Hope Holistic Care Ltd (HHC) is committed to providing an exceptional customer experience. Feedback and complaints provide us with valuable information that helps us to resolve customer issues, and to understand where we are doing well, and where we can improve. Feedback is information about reactions to a product, action or service. Feedback may be a query, request, or a compliment. A complaint is a formal statement that something is unsatisfactory or unacceptable This policy should be read in conjunction with the Feedback and Complaints Resolution procedure. 2. Scope This policy applies to all feedback and complaints that relate to HHC’s products or services (including employees, volunteers and contractors delivering those services) or how we manage customers’ personal information. This policy does not apply to: • grievances between two (or more) employees, that does not impact a customer (see Grievance Management policy) • investigation of internal fraud–related complaints (see Fraud Prevention and Control policy). 3. Policy HHC is committed to being open and responsive to any feedback and complaints offered by our clients, their carers or advocates, or the broader community. HHC will maintain a Feedback and Complaints Resolution System, to ensure that all feedback and complaints are considered and resolved in a timely and impartial fashion. HHC will maintain a register of all feedback and complaints information, that will provide transparency regarding how feedback and complaints are managed. This register will be centrally managed by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). HHC encourages parties who have feedback or complaints in relation to the services they have received, the management of their personal information or the actions of our employees or volunteers, to raise it directly with us. HHC will make it as easy as possible for people to provide feedback and complaints, by: • providing information about the feedback and complaints resolution processes, in easy-to-understand formats, on the HHC’s website and at the office location; Feedback and Complaint Management Policy_POL_V01_2201 1|Page Feedback and Complaint Management Policy • accepting complaints in a variety of formats (e.g. written, verbal); • assisting people to submit feedback and complaints, either to us or an external complaints handling body; • involving carers and advocates in the complaints process (if requested by the complainant); • making people aware of external complaints bodies (e.g. My Aged Care, Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission) where complaints can be escalated. Should there be three requests from the same client regarding similar matters of a dissatisfactory nature within a 3 month period, the request will be treated as a complaint. HHC will address all complaints in a confidential manner. Only the people directly involved in making, investigating or resolving a complaint will have access to the information. Complainants may make complaints anonymously if desired. HHC will ensure the complaints resolution process: • commences within 48 hours of receipt of the complaint (this includes contacting the complainant), with an investigation and response to the complainant being completed within 21 working days of receipt of the complaint; • is fair and impartial, and follows ‘Procedural Fairness’ rules; • involves the complainant, and any other parties affected by the complaint, in the resolution of the complaint, as far as is reasonably practicable; • makes appropriate support and assistance available to the complainant, throughout the complaint process.

HHC acknowledges that individuals have the right to complain directly to external complaints bodies (e.g. My Aged Care, Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission) regarding the products and services offered by HHC or our management of a customers’ personal information. Enquiries from external complaints bodies or regulators regarding HHC feedback and complaints processes, or regarding a specific complaint, will be referred to and managed by the CEO, or delegate.

It is particularly common for older Australians living in aged care facilities to experience falls. Hope Holistic Care (HHC) is committed to taking necessary measures to prevent falls and fall-related harm from occurring in our facilities. We will ensure appropriate falls assessment, prevention and management strategies are effectively implemented. We will also ensure that workers are adequately trained on how to assess, identify and mitigate falls. Definitions Syncope (fainting): is a temporary loss of consciousness, often related to insufficient blood flow to the brain. Most commonly occurring when blood pressure is too low, and the heart doesn’t pump enough oxygen to the brain. Polypharmacy: is the concurrent use of multiple medications by a patient. Vestibular dysfunction: is a common cause of dizziness among the older population. Continence: is the ability of a person to control bowel and bladder movements. Procedures Risk Screening and Assessment HHC will conduct a screening and assessment of all clients in our facilities upon arrival and every six months. This falls risk screening process will be undertaken by a Registered Nurse and will include the following assessment from the best practice guidelines, to determine if the resident is a high or low falls risk. After determining the risk category of each client, an individualised management plan will be developed by Registered staff which outlines the main falls risks and mitigations strategies. The management plan will be used so that all staff are aware of the risks posed to each individual client, and any additional environmental or medical strategies which may need to be implemented. Syncope (fainting) All clients will be assessed for syncope on arrival at the facility. Presyncope, syncope and postural hypotension will be included when developing the client’s management plan for falls prevention. The root causes of clients who report having unexplained falls or episodes will be identified and addressed. Dizziness and vertigo Clients will be assessed for vestibular dysfunction if they experience dizziness, vertigo or imbalance. Vestibular rehabilitation will be implemented to treat dizziness and balance problems where indicated. Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 1|Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy Vision Clients will receive an eye examination on arrival to determine if they have cataracts. Clients who have severe visual impairments will receive visual aids if necessary, and their environment will be modified accordingly. Client participation HHC will ensure that clients are involved during the falls prevention processes. We will: • provide information which frames falls prevention as a means for clients to remain independent for longer; • provide information on ‘falls prevention’ to clients in a manner they understand; • seek client input in discussions about preventing falls; • develop falls prevention programs which accommodate the individual client’s needs; and • identify potential barriers the client may face when taking part in actions to prevent falls. Staff training HHC’s Registered staff will be trained on how to undertake screening and assessment of new clients to determine if they are a high or low falls risk. The Registered staff will be trained on how to identify potential barriers or hazards which could result in falls and injury. The care staff responsible for assisting clients who wear hip-protectors will undertake relevant training on the correct application of hip protectors. Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 2|Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy Management Strategies Feet and footwear Clients’ footwear will be reviewed regularly to ensure it meets the safety guidelines. Clients will be encouraged to wear soft soled shoes as opposed to slippers. Clients will also be encouraged to wear footwear when walking, to avoid the increased risk of falling barefoot. The facility will, where possible, provide grip socks to all clients who present a high falls risk, to wear during the night. Clients will be offerreded to be referred to a podiatrist on arrival if they present with foot issues which require specialised attention, who may assist in falls prevention. Environmental considerations HHC will monitor the client’s environment and be attentive to feedback concerning near misses and recommend mitigation strategies where fall risks are identified, including to report to My Aged Care for reassessment to get assistance with Home modifications. Minimising injuries from falls Hip protectors will be given to clients who require them. HHC will consider the clients’ falls history, mobility, steadiness, gait, disability status, osteoporosis and body index when deciding whether to use hip-protectors. HHC will also ensure that clients who require assistance to use hip-protectors receive the necessary support. Restraints HHC will not apply restraints at anytime or under any circumstances. If a staff member is at risk of harm, they are advised to exit the client’s home to a safe place before reporting to the Case manager of office personnel. Observation HHC will work with the client and/or their representative to ensure that higher falls risk clients are closely observed, such as via regular phone calls. Clients with dementia and other clients who have a high risk of falling, will be encouraged to apply devices which can detect their falls and send responses to designated contacts. Continence Clients will also be offered continence assessments to check if they have problems that can be modified or prevented. Improving balance with mobility and exercise HHC will develop tailored physical activity and exercise programs for clients to help strengthen and improve stability, strength and mobility. HHC will assess balance, strength and mobility through a variety of tools and tests. These tests may include: - functional reach - six-metre walk - timed up-and-go - sit-to-stand - spring balance Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 3|Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy Medication management Case managers, Registered Staff and Care workers should be aware of the medications each client is taking and how those medications effect whether they are a high or low risk patient (e.g. knowing antidepressants are associated with higher risk of falls). HHC will encourage all clients who experience a fall have their medications reviewed by a pharmacist. Responding to Falls All clients who have a fall, will undergo a post-fall assessment taken by Registered staff. All falls will be documented and recorded by Registered staff. Responding to falls checklist No. 1 3 4 6 Item Tick when complete Offer basic support and provide immediate reassurance 2 Take baseline measures including: - pulse - blood pressure - respiratory rate - oxygen saturation - blood sugar levels - if client hit head – record neurological observations and inform medical officer for further investigation. Check for injuries Move the client - assess whether it is safe to move them - use a lifting device and comply with lifting procedures 5 Monitor the resident: - for potential internal bleeding (if alcoholic or on blood thinning medications) - ensure continued monitoring of the resident in case injuries appear later Report the fall to a medical officer immediately. 7 Record the fall - include details on client’s medical record, location of fall, evidence of injury, response - type of fall - dependency of client on staff/aids - clothing, footwear and eyewear if relevant at time of fall - changes in medication - restraints used - observation at the time - contributing environmental factors - witnesses to the fall Discuss the fall and future risk management strategies 8 Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 4|Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy Client records HHC will ensure that all clients’ falls risk status and falls history is recorded in their client file/individualised management plan.

The National Consensus Statement consists of essential elements for recognising and responding to acute physiological deterioration (third edition) November 2021 (Essential elements recognising and responding - acute physiological deterioration third edition) is used as the basis for this policy and procedure. It is acknowledged that the scope of the consensus statement relates to acute health services. However, the Consensus Statement ‘focuses on ensuring that a clinical safety net is in place for patients whose physiological condition is acutely deteriorating, and outlines the organisational supports that are needed to provide this safety net.’ The essential elements identified are used as a framework to ensure timely identification of client deterioration to support their clinical safety. Each contact with our clients is an opportunity to observe and monitor their wellbeing. The client should be the focus of each staff member’s contact with information sought in relation to their wellbeing.

Hope Holistic Care fosters a rights-based, learning environment for older people to live the best life they can. HHC promotes dignity of risk as a way to maintain client independence, responsibility and ultimately, meaningful living. HHC exercises its Duty of Care to protect clients in areas they may be vulnerable to harm compared to an fully-abled human being. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf4Y7v-SLtc (Duty of Care, Dignity of Risk, Overprotection, Neglect) Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy Policy Client Decision Making and Choice Hope Holistic Care is committed to empowering clients to play an active role in decisions that affect their lives and to make choices for themselves: The organisation will: • inform clients about the opportunities for choice available to them • support clients to make informed choices which will provide them opportunities • keep records of client preferences regarding their service • enable clients to build self-reliance and maintain social inclusion Supported Decision-Making and Dignity of Risk Hope Holistic Care acknowledges that all clients have a human right to make decisions about their own life and to have those decisions respected. Hope Holistic Care understands and affirms that cognitive impairment is not a reason for a person to be excluded from the decision-making process about their own life. Hope Holistic Care understands that not all decisions require assistance and will support clients primarily when they make significant decisions which have immediate or long-term consequences regarding their health, finances or lifestyle. Hope Holistic Care is committed to supporting clients with complex care and communication needs to make their own decisions regarding their life. The will and preferences of a client will only be overridden if a decision is deemed by staff or advocates to be dangerous to the wellbeing of the client or others. Definitions Decision is a planned course of action, either short or long term, regarding the lifestyle, healthcare or financial affairs of an individual. Dignity of risk is the recognition that every individual should be able to do something that has a level of risk involved, whether real or perceived. Financial Decisions include but are not limited to: • Investment decisions; • Sale or gifts of property or valuable possessions; • Use of money. Functional Capacity Assessment is an assessment of an individual’s decision-making capacity in the present moment. The assessment should focus on the person’s understanding of the decision, its context and consequences, and should not contain a judgement on whether a person’s decision is wise or unwise. Healthcare Decisions include but are not limited to: • Seeking or obtaining a diagnosis; Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy _POL_V01_2209 1|Page Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy • Accessing (or refusing) care services; • Responding to crisis (falls, incidents); • Agreeing or refusing medical treatment; • Advance care planning. Lifestyle Decisions include but are not limited to: • Living arrangements; • Relationships; • Employment; • Civic participation; • Holidays and outings; • Pets and possessions. Representative is a person or organisation that assists the client in the decision-making process and, where necessary, makes decisions on behalf of the client. A Representative is designated by a client, or by appointment from another body if the client is unfit to nominate a Representative, and includes a Substitute Decision Maker. Substitute Decision Maker (guardian) is a legally appointed person such as a guardian to make decisions on behalf of a client in certain areas, for example Healthcare Decisions and Lifestyle Decisions, or a financial manager to make Financial Decisions. A Substitute Decision Maker should work with a client’s informal support networks to support a client to build their decision-making capacity. Substituted Judgement is a decision made by a Representative regarding a client who is unable to communicate their will and preferences, or when a client’s will and preferences infringe on their rights or the rights of others. A Substituted Judgement is based on the client’s previous expressed will and preferences or, if this is unknown, a Representative’s interpretation of ‘what the client would have wanted’. Supporter is a person or organisation who is designated by the client or organisation to aid in the communication and development of the client’s wishes regarding their care. Supporters may be required to aid in the decision-making process, however the ultimate decision-making power lies with the client. Procedures Choice Information strategies Information in appropriate formats about the opportunities for client choice will be provided to clients at each major service point from intake to end of service. If clients have literacy or communication issues, then every effort should be made to ensure they understand their rights and opportunities in making decisions regarding services. The information is available in the following documents: • Consultation about HHC services • Care planning process Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy _POL_V01_2209 2|Page Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy • Review of Care Plan • Annual Survey • Advance care planning • Complaints Support to make choices Clients will have the opportunity to make choices about their service in the following ways: • service delivery access - types of service available, the days and times a service can be accessed, frequency of attendance, the location, how the service is provided to ensure that it meets individual needs (particularly in terms of physical, cultural or communication needs) • individual service planning - expressing preferences for the level or intensity of service, which other services are involved, the ways that personal goals will be achieved, how progress reviews are conducted, and decisions about changes or exiting the service Hope Holistic Care actively supports service users to make choices in the way they use services: • follow-up on written information and specific assistance to clients who may experience cultural or language barriers, or who may need specialised advocacy or support to take full advantage of the opportunities, providing information in a range of mediums: written, pictorial, verbal. Record keeping Hope Holistic Care documents all input from clients regarding their service preferences. This is recorded on the client’s file. Supported Decision making and Dignity of Risk Clients will be provided with access to the support necessary for them to make, communicate and participate in decisions regarding their life and care. Clients should be provided with a Chinese format of this policy and be supported to understand it. Staff will receive information and training on the nature of capacity in decision-making and how to support client decision-making that upholds clients’ rights. Designating the role of Supporters and Representatives Supporters and Representatives should be designated by or with the consent of the client, and their roles can be formalised into a written decision-making agreement. To avoid conflicts of interest, Supporters and Representatives should preferably not be in a position where they have interests in Hope Holistic Care or any other service provider delivering services to the client, as this may compromise their role. Where this is unavoidable, the written supported decision-making agreement should include a declaration of any conflicts of interest if they exist, and specify how actual or potential conflicts will be managed. Supported decision-making should occur in collaboration with informal support networks such as friends, family, peer support and independent advocates. This will help to create a natural safeguard for the client and prevent Supporters from making decisions which are not in the client’s best interests. Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy _POL_V01_2209 3|Page Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy Assessing client decision-making capacity Care workers will notify the Case Manager if there are concerns regarding a client’s decision-making capacity. The Case Manager will assess the situation and discuss with the client and their carer/representative regarding decision making support processes. Suggestions may be made to refer the client to relevant and qualified assessors (e.g. Solicitor, GP, social worker etc) for an assessment to be made to determine the client’s decision-making capacity. Substituted Judgement If it is determined that the client is unfit to make a decision regarding their life, their will and preferences will be overridden, and a Substituted Judgement will be made by the authorised Representative. This is considered as a last resort. Clients will only receive a Substituted Judgement or have their will and preferences overridden if: • They cannot understand any of the risks associated with their decisions; or • The proposed decision presents a threat to the wellbeing of the client or others. Supporting decision-making The current or previously expressed will and preferences of the client will be respected and carried out unless they are unlawful, or compromise other rights such as their right to safety, or the rights of others. In the process of supporting a client’s decision: 1. A client’s will and preference should be respected and given effect; If will and preference are not known: 2. The Representative(s) must make a decision on what the client would likely want, based on the information available; If it is not possible to determine what the client would likely want: 3. The Representative must act to preserve the client’s human rights and make the least restrictive decisions regarding those rights. Where clients require assistance in the communication of their will and preference, the organisation will provide the appropriate tools and strategies for the client to express themselves. This may include use of pictures, assistive technology or language services. Staff will support and assist clients to understand the context and consequences of their decisions. Staff will work proactively with clients to establish social histories, life-story work and care plans as documentation which might assist in future decision-making scenarios. Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy _POL_V01_2209 4|Page Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy Dignity of risk Supporters will respect an individual’s right to the dignity of risk and will not dissuade them from making a decision based on the associated risks alone, whether real or perceived. If a client’s decision involves some level of risk, Supporters should ensure that the client can foresee and understand the risks associated with the decision. Staff will attempt to manage the risks associated with significant decisions, while not attempting to change the client’s mind regarding a decision. Process for dealing with perceived conflict of interest If a staff member or person from a client’s support network believes a Representative or Supporter is not acting in the best interests of a client, they are to notify the Home Care Manager as soon as possible. Following a complaint in relation to an assisted decision, the Home Care Manager will assess whether the Representative or Supporter’s vested interest in the decision influenced their actions. If it is found that the Supporter or Representative had a vested interest in a decision and the decision made was not in the best interests of the client, they will be removed as a Supporter or Representative. If required, matters involving the abuse of Representative decision-making may be referred to the Guardianship tribunal or the Police or a relevant external body, depending on the situation. Documentation For Substituted Judgements that may have significant immediate and long-term consequences, the decision-making process and outcome will be documented and will be stored in the client’s case file.

    "data_breach = \"Data Breach Response Plan V01_2305 TBC Responsibilities and delegations Record of procedure development Version Date of Approved Date for Review This procedure applies to Specific responsibilities Procedure approval All staff with access to personal information CEO, IT Committee IT Committee Data breach response plan Policy Hope Holistic Care is committed to protecting the privacy and personal information that it holds about individuals. Hope Holistic Care will act appropriately and in a timely manner in the event of a data breach, to contain the possible resulting harm and notify individuals affected as required. Definitions Data Breach: When personal information held by an organisation is disclosed accidentally, lost, or accessed without permission. This can be as a result of human error, or through malicious action by an employee or an external party. Examples include where a secure IT system containing personal information has been hacked, a storage device being lost by an employee, or an employee accidentally releasing personal information to the wrong person. Personal information: ‘Information about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable: whether the information or opinion is true or not; and whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not.’ (Privacy Act 1988, Section 6) Procedure Identify When staff have reason to believe there has been a data breach, they should inform the Office immediately. At this time, details such as when and how the breach was discovered, and by whom, should be recorded. This will be recorded in the incident register. Contain As soon as a breach or suspected breach has been identified, any steps to contain or limit the potential harm should be taken. This may include shutting down a system that has been breached, or recovering any records. The CEO will complete a preliminary assessment of the breach and take any immediate action to contain the breach if possible. Assess If the preliminary assessment finds that further investigation and assessment is necessary to understand the nature and extent of the breach, it will be escalated to the data breach response team. The team will work together to gather information, assess risks and the likelihood of serious harm from the breach, and therefore whether it is an ‘eligible’ (notifiable) breach. To evaluate whether a known data breach is notifiable, consider the following three questions: • Has there been unauthorised access, unauthorised disclosure, accidental loss, or theft of personal information that the organisation holds? Data Breach Response Plan _POL_V01_2305 1|Page Data breach response plan For example, the organisation’s database is hacked, a portable storage device containing personal information is lost, or the organisation accidentally releases personal information to the wrong person. • Is it likely that this may result in serious harm to individual/s whose data has been breached? This can include but is not limited to psychological, financial, emotional, physical or reputational harm. To be able to accurately assess the likelihood and seriousness of harm, it requires looking at the context of the data and how it may have been breached. For information about the factors to consider when deciding whether harm is likely and/or serious, refer to section 26WG of the Privacy Amendment (Notifiable Data Breaches) Act 2017 • Does the likelihood of serious harm remain despite taking available remedial action? The obligation to notify the OAIC can be avoided if the organisation takes remedial action in a timely manner to prevent the risk of harm occurring, either by making the harm unlikely to occur, or non-serious. If the answer to the above three questions is yes, then the breach classifies as an eligible data breach and organisations are required to notify the OAIC and any affected individuals. If there are reasonable grounds to suspect that there has been a data breach, the data response team should conduct an assessment of the suspected breach. The assessment of a suspected breach must take place within 30 days of it occurring, and should seek to find out the likelihood of serious harm occurring as a result of the suspected breach. If it is assessed to be likely, this has the same notification obligations as a known data breach under the NDB Scheme. Take remedial action Remedial action can be taken at any point throughout the data breach response process – the sooner the better. However, it may be that the full extent and nature of the breach, and therefore the actions that could be taken, are not known until after assessing and investigating the breach. Examples of remedial action include remotely deleting sensitive information from a laptop which has been lost, or emailing affected individuals with advice to change their password details for an online account for which login information may have been hacked. The data breach response team should document the process of any remedial action, making sure to document rationale and reasoning as to why a certain conclusion has been made. If, after the remedial action has been taken, the risk of harm is reduced so that it is unlikely to occur, or non-serious, then there is no requirement to notify. Even if there is no requirement, however, the data response team should consider whether to contact affected individuals with advice for further protecting their information as a customer service measure. Notify Once a breach has been assessed as eligible, relevant individuals and bodies should be notified as soon as practicable. Notification must include the following information as a minimum: Data Breach Response Plan _POL_V01_2305 2|Page Data breach response plan • The organisation’s name and contact details • Description of the data breach • Type of information involved in the breach • Advice and recommendations for individuals to take in response 1. The OAIC The CEO is responsible for notifying and liaising with the OAIC for data breaches which have been assessed as eligible for the purposes of the Notifiable Data Breaches Scheme, using the OAIC’s Notifiable Data Breach form. 2. Notification of individuals who are at likely risk of serious harm due to the data breach The way notification occurs will depend on the context and nature of the breach, and the relationship of the individuals affected to the organisation. It should occur as soon as practicable after completing the notification statement for the OAIC. Individuals may be contacted by phone and email. A public notification may also occur. Notification to affected individuals may contain an explanation of what happened to their personal information, an apology, description of what measures have been put in place as a result of the breach, and advice on what they can do to further protect their information. Record and review Data breach log A data breach log will record all instances of data breaches or suspected breaches, as well as document assessments of the breach and any changes made as a result of a breach. All staff should be made aware of the log, and the CEO will be responsible for ensuring that all breaches or suspected breaches are recorded accurately in the log. Review Whether or not the breach or suspected breach was notifiable, a review should be conducted into processes relating to the breach to strengthen protections in the future. Depending on the type and seriousness of the breach, this may include: • A full investigation into how the breach occurred • Implement measures to ensure it does not reoccur, documented in a prevention plan • Reviews of security, cybersecurity and ICT policies and procedures • Audit of implementation of relevant policies and procedures • Additional staff training about privacy and data breach responses Data Breach Response Plan _POL_V01_2305 3|Page\"\n",

We need to remember to protect their confidentiality, and only share information to those who are also involved with their care. Before sharing any information, think about why you are sharing it. If it is necessary, be mindful to share only what needs to be known for that purpose. Also, think about whether you would like others talking about you in the same way. This applies to our colleagues and company information as well. Remember that we entrust each other with our information so that we can help meet each other’s needs. “Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen.” Ephesians 4:29 If you want to know more about this subject, you can access our Privacy Policy or talk to your manager about it. Safety, Security and Abuse When clients open their home to us, they are giving us a lot of power. We need to be mindful of this and use it responsibly. In everything we do or say, it’s important that we do so safely, as well as making them feel safe and secure. Abuse can occur when we come across as threatening, disrespectful; when we ignore their needs; when we touch them inappropriately; when we use physical force, or take advantage of their belongings, such as money. It is best that we treat our clients and colleagues with respect and humility. We need to show our concern for them by asking them if they feel safe and take actions if they say otherwise. “Do not devise harm against your neighbour, while he lives securely beside you.” Proverbs 3:29 If you want to find out more, you can refer to our Abuse and Neglect Policy or talk to your manager about it. Appearance Appearance can affect the comfort of clients we serve as well as what they think of the organisation. Therefore, we should always dress appropriately, being presentable, professional, clean, neat and tidy. All Care staff will be supplied with at least one HHC uniform shirt by the Office. Please use it and wash regularly. Appearance Guidelines Please follow the below guidelines: • Identification badges should be worn to let clients know your name Staff Handbook 2|Page Staff Handbook • In general, shoes should be sturdy, low heeled, protect the foot and have slip-resistant soles.

Hair When providing direct care, please tie your hair back if it is longer than shoulder length for hygiene purposes. Personal Items We should only be bringing what we need into the house. Consider bringing a small bag and keep it near the entrance of the home. This is to prevent suspicions of theft by the client. Try not to bring many personal items into the residence. Jewellery/Nails For safety purposes, when providing care, we should not wear rings (other than wedding bands), bracelets (other than medical alert bracelets), very long fingernails, nail polish, drop earrings and necklaces. Ear studs may be worn. This is to preserve the skin integrity of our clients and prevent unnecessary injury. Mobile phones We should generally refrain from using our mobile phones for personal reasons when working with a client. It is best to be kept in your bag so that you can pay attention to the client. If you are expecting an important call, notify the client in advance and minimise the time spent on the call. Smoking For the health and safety of our clients and colleagues, all working environments, including the client’s house and surrounds, are smoke-free. We encourage all staff to refrain from smoking whilst on shift and/or whilst travelling between clients. Hygiene and Infection Control Our clients can get very sick if they are infected with viruses or bacteria into their home. For the safety of them and us, we should keep ourselves clean and use personal protective equipment at appropriate times. This includes regular hand sanitisation, mask and glove wearing. You should always have these supplies with you. If you need to replenish them, please contact the office and we will arrange to deliver these to you. Please read the Infection Prevention and Control Policy and talk to your manager if you have any questions. Work Health and Safety Your health and safety are important to HHC. HHC is committed to the following: • Regularly talk to you and ask you about work health and safety • Develop safe procedures for everyone to use every day, including for emergencies • Provide reporting systems and injury management What we need you to do is to: • Use of the Home Safety Checklist at the client’s home before services start • Take care for the safety of yourself and others Staff Handbook 3|Page Staff Handbook • Comply with health and safety directions • Report incidents and injury immediately • Report and control hazards as you identify them, and report to management as needed Learning and Development We learn by experience and seeking answers to questions that come up in what we do each day. Therefore, HHC will actively encourage individual staff to reflect on the clients and services to identify opportunities for learning. We also organise group education sessions on topics that have been raised through client needs, staff requests and as required by industry standards or legislation. Employee relations Probation For Permanent or full-time staff, we generally provide a probationary period of 3 months, unless there is written notice from us to indicate otherwise. Payroll Enquiries Hope Holistic Care operates on a fortnightly pay cycle. Please contact the Office for any payroll enquiries Salary Packaging Hope Holistic Care is classified as a “public benevolent institution” (PBI). Therefore, it is able to offer full-time and part-time employees salary packaging – reimbursing employees’ bills (tax free) up to $15,900 per annum. For more information, please contact the Office. Travel When visiting clients, the first trip to the client from your home and the last trip returning home will not be included in the mileage reimbursement. We will calculate the mileage for travel between the clients based on Google Maps and automatically pay you as travel allowance. If you assist the client with transportation or shopping during the visit, you will be able to report it in the app to claim reimbursement. Unless specified, there will not be any reimbursement for tolls paid during the travel to clients’ homes. Parking fines or any traffic infringements are not payable by HHC. Discrimination and Harassment Hope Holistic Care strives to maintain a working environment free from all forms of harassment or intimidation. Threatening, insulting or abusive words or behaviour towards another, or by displaying threatening, insulting or abusive words or pictures, unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favours and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature are serious violations of our policy and will not be condoned or permitted. HHC will not tolerate behaviour which is offensive, intimidating, humiliating, malicious, insulting or embarrassing and which is aimed at making an individual or group of individuals feel miserable, humiliated or lacking in self-confidence. It is expected that people in our workplace will behave in accordance with our Code of Ethical Behaviour. All reports of harassment, victimisation and bullying will be taken seriously, managed promptly and be treated with sensitivity and confidentiality. Staff Handbook 4|Page Staff Handbook Responsibilities Everyone is responsible to create and maintain a workplace environment that is free from any form of harassment. Managers and Supervisors Managers and supervisors must ensure that acceptable standards of behaviour are maintained in the workplace and have communicated the message that harassment will not be tolerated within the workplace. To meet these requirements, managers should: • Ensure the work environment is free from discriminatory practices and unwelcome or offensive behaviour • Treat harassment seriously, actively intervene and take early corrective action to deal with any behaviour or actions that may be considered inappropriate • Handle any complaints in a fair, confidential and expeditious manner • Ensure reprisal toward affected individuals does not occur • Model appropriate behaviour • Seek assistance from HR where there is any issue pertaining to harassment Staff Members and Volunteers All staff and volunteers are required to maintain acceptable standards of conduct and ensure that work is carried out in an environment free from all forms of harassment.

We encourage all employees to take responsibility for raising issues in a constructive way that will allow the organisation to acknowledge and take appropriate action. Any employee who believes that they have been unfairly treated, has the right to discuss the issue with their manager. Every manager within the organisation who has a grievance brought to their attention has the following obligations: • To take the matter seriously • To record the conversation and any agreed outcome • To refer the matter to an appropriate person who can help the manager and employee resolve the issue In extreme circumstances, Hope Holistic Care may seek the assistance of an external qualified grievance management body to assist in resolving the matter.

Anonymous grievances will not be pursued by Hope Holistic Care. Senior management will treat all issues fairly, confidentially and without repercussions. False allegations are considered by Hope Holistic Care to be deliberate and wilful misconduct. Performance Management and Disciplinary Action The purpose of the performance management and disciplinary processes are to outline the steps that are required to be taken in order to resolve a performance management issue or a breach of terms and conditions of employment or organisation policy. This procedure is used to: • Ensure fair treatment of staff at all times • Establish a consistent approach to handling disciplinary matters • Ensure that staff effort is channelled in the right direction • Bring about a suitable change in any undesirable conduct/performance • Prevent a situation of consistently unsatisfactory conduct/performance arising The purpose of counselling is to advise the staff member of any performance/conduct of concern and to establish if the organisation can provide assistance to avoid further instances of unacceptable performance/ conduct, whether through training, coaching or some other action. Summary Dismissal If you exhibit behaviour or engage in action that is either unlawful, negligent, or grossly offensive, you may be summarily dismissed. Examples include, but are not limited to: abuse, drug/alcohol abuse, misappropriation of funds, falsification of records, wilful refusal to obey reasonable directions and organisational policies/procedures.

    "        \"Hello! If you've observed a bruise on a client's hand and neither the client nor the family knows how it happened, it is important to document and monitor the situation closely as part of your duty of care. According to the 'Incident Management Policy' document, you should follow these steps: Assessment and Investigation: The Home Care Manager is responsible for creating an initial assessment of the incident to determine the severity and establish the need for an investigation. If an incident is a Reportable Incident, an internal investigation will take place. Documenting the Incident: All relevant information and documentation related to investigations should be recorded and kept confidential, including details of any conversations, emails, documents, and where possible, records of face-to-face interviews. Monitoring: After recording the incident, it's essential to monitor the client for any changes or development of symptoms that may relate to the injury. This is to ensure that any further incidents are prevented and to provide adequate care for any complications that might arise from the initial bruise. It is also important to make sure that the injury is recorded in the client's medical record and that any further risk management strategies are discussed and implemented if necessary. You should refer to your organization’s specific protocols, as there may be additional local steps to take in such situations. If unsure, contact the Home Care Manager for further guidance on the proper course of action for documenting and monitoring injuries like bruises. Please check the provided 'Incident Management Policy' for complete and detailed guidelines on how to proceed in such cases.\",\n",
    "        \"Hello! To support a client who got nauseous and had trouble controlling their bladder during a car ride home, you should refer to the 'HHC Staff Handbook' where it may have guidelines on health and safety, providing support to clients, and managing incidents. In general, to support the client, you can assure them that they are in a safe environment and that you are there to help. If possible, stop the car safely and assist the client in cleaning up or changing clothes if they have any spare. Provide them with water and help them to stay calm and comfortable. Use any supplies you might have in the car, such as towels or wet wipes; if you need supplies to be replenished, contact the office so they can arrange to deliver these to you. Record the incident according to your organization's policies and report it to your manager. After the incident, complete a Home Safety Checklist to ensure that the environment remains safe for both the client and staff. This guidance aims at maintaining the safety and dignity of the client while also ensuring that you are following the workplace's health and safety directives. Please consult the 'HHC Staff Handbook' for specific policies and procedures related to your question on how to support clients during transportation and handling such situations, as it's important to align with your organization’s specific guidelines.\",\n",
    "        \"Hello! In the event that a client's appointment got rescheduled without prior knowledge, the best practice would be to communicate effectively to resolve the situation: Contact the Medical Practitioner's Office: As soon as you become aware of the scheduling issue, reach out to the client's medical practitioner's office to confirm the details of the rescheduling and gather information about the new appointment time and date. Inform the Client and/or Representative: Inform the client and their representative about the change as soon as possible to ensure they are aware and can make any necessary adjustments to their plans. Update Documentation: Ensure that all changes in appointment details are updated in the care documentation and that the care plan reflects this new information . Report the Incident: If applicable, report the scheduling issue to the Home Care Manager or management, as it may affect care planning or require further action. Review Policies and Procedures: After the situation is resolved, review the current policies and procedures to see if any improvements can be made to prevent similar issues in the future, such as double-checking appointment times or ensuring contact information is up to date . By following these steps, you can manage the rescheduling incident efficiently while minimizing disruption to the client's care. If you have any further questions or need assistance with policy details, please refer to the 'Deterioration Policy' for comprehensive guidance.\",\n",
    "        \"Hello! Care workers are expected to perform tasks within their defined scope of practice. Activities such as cleaning ceilings are not typically within the scope of care work and could pose safety and health risks. To ensure that care work is done safely and effectively, workers should follow these guidelines: Scope of Practice: Care workers should perform tasks that are outlined in their job descriptions and aligned with their training and qualifications. If a task like cleaning ceilings is outside of this scope, it is important for the care worker to communicate this to their supervisor or manager. Safety and Health Risks: Care workers should not be performing tasks that could jeopardize their health or safety or that of the clients. If a task seems unsafe or inappropriate, it should be discussed with a supervisor as soon as possible. Communication: Concerns about tasks that are outside a care worker's scope should be reported to management. The worker should clearly and promptly communicate their concerns to ensure that appropriate action can be taken. Policies and Procedures: The care worker should review the relevant policies and procedures regarding their scope of work and job duties. These policies should outline the expected tasks and steps to take if assigned tasks outside of this scope. For these reasons, a care worker performing tasks such as cleaning ceilings should discuss the matter with their immediate supervisor to clarify their responsibilities and duties. This will ensure that work is performed within the scope of practice and without compromising safety. Please consider reviewing the 'Infection Prevention and Control Policy' and other relevant policy documents to ensure that any work performed aligns with the organization's standards and the care worker’s professional scope of practice【0†Infection Prevention and Control Policy】.\",\n",

Here are steps you should take: Document the Service Provided: Make a record of the services you provided during the visit, including the date, time, duration, and any care or assistance given. Communication with the Office: As soon as possible, communicate with your supervisor or the administrative office to inform them that the visit actually occurred despite the cancellation.

    "        \"Hello! To prevent similar incidents in the future where a client might slip and fall, the following measures should be taken in accordance with the 'Falls Prevention and Management Policy' document: Risk Screening and Assessment: Conduct regular screening and assessment to identify clients at high risk of falls. After assessing, create an individualized management plan outlining the main fall risks and mitigation strategies【0†Falls Prevention Management Policy】. Feet and Footwear: Ensure that the client's footwear is appropriate and safe, promoting the use of soft-soled shoes over slippers and providing grip socks for night use if the client is at high falls risk【0†Falls Prevention Management Policy】. Environmental Considerations: Monitor the client’s environment for potential hazards and make necessary modifications. Be attentive to feedback about near misses and report to appropriate services like My Aged Care for a reassessment and possible home modifications【0†Falls Prevention Management Policy】. Client Education: Inform and involve clients in falls prevention strategies, providing information in a manner they can understand and seeking their input on how to prevent falls. Develop falls prevention programs tailored to the individual client’s needs【0†Falls Prevention Management Policy】. Observation and Monitoring: For clients at higher risk of falls, ensure that they are closely observed. Encourage the use of devices that can detect falls and send alerts to designated contacts if needed【0†Falls Prevention Management Policy】. Improving Balance and Mobility: Craft tailored physical activity and exercise programs for clients to strengthen and improve their stability, strength, and mobility【0†Falls Prevention Management Policy】. In the specific scenario you mentioned, it might be helpful to: Check the driveway for uneven surfaces, loose material, or other hazards that could increase fall risk. Suggest to the client using a rubbish bin with wheels or offering assistance when taking out the rubbish to minimize the risk of falling when walking down the driveway. By adopting these measures, you can work towards creating a safer environment for your clients and reducing the risk of future falls. If you have further questions or need to implement specific measures, refer to detailed guidelines outlined in the 'Falls Prevention and Management Policy' document【0†Falls Prevention Management Policy】.\",\n",

Immediate Assistance: If you observe that the client is not being careful with navigating through the streets, assess whether it is safe to approach them to offer assistance. Your presence might provide comfort and reduce the risk of an incident. Notify Your Supervisor or Management: Report the incident to your supervisor or management as soon as possible for further advice and to initiate any necessary follow-up actions. Documentation: Document the event, including the sequence of events, actions taken, and the outcome, to ensure that there is a record of the incident.

      "         \"Policy HHC\\u2019s incident management system is consumer-centred, and focuses on the health, safety, wellbeing, and quality of life of consumers and anyone affected by an incident. Following an incident, HHC\\u2019s investigation and resolution processes are outcomes-focused and conducted in line with the principles of Open Disclosure. HHC is committed to ensuring that all incidents and near misses which occur in relation to the provision of services are managed consistently and effectively, and that workers can identify, manage, report and resolve incidents. The organisation collects and reviews data on incidents in order to inform improvement activities. HHC regularly reviews its incident management system and processes to ensure that they are: Well documented; Readily accessible to all workers employed or engaged by the organisation; Reflective and adaptive, with an intent to prevent incidents; and Compliant with the Serious Incident Response Scheme. Definitions Commission Incidents Reportable incidents refers to the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission are acts, omissions, events or circumstances that occur or could occur during or in relation to the provision of care and services, or the alteration or withdrawal of care and services, that cause harm, either physically or emotionally, to a worker, consumer, or other stakeholder. Incidents also include acts, omissions, events or circumstances that have caused or could cause damage to property, the environment, material or cause public alarm. are alleged, suspected or actual incidents which have occurred in connection with service delivery, where the person affected by the incident is a consumer, of severity that must be reported to the Commission. This includes but is not limited to: \\u2022 Unexpected death; \\u2022 Unexplained absence; \\u2022 Unreasonable use of force; \\u2022 Psychological or emotional abuse; \\u2022 Neglect; \\u2022 Unlawful or inappropriate sexual contact; \\u2022 Stealing or financial coercion by a staff member; and \\u2022 Inappropriate physical or chemical restraint. are Reportable Incidents of a higher level of harm than Priority 2 incidents and must be reported to the Commission within a more immediate timeframe. Priority 1 incidents include: \\u2022 Physical or psychological injury or illness requiring onsite medical or psychological treatment to resolve; \\u2022 Incidents where there are reasonable grounds to report the incident to police; or Priority 1 incidents Incident Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 1|Page Incident Management Policy Priority 2 incidents Workers Procedures \\u2022 A consumer\\u2019s unexpected death or a consumer\\u2019s unexplained absence from the service. All \\u2018Priority 1\\u2019 incidents must be reported to the Commission within 24 hours. are Reportable Incidents which are not Priority 1 incidents, and which result in a lower level of harm to a consumer, which must be reported to the Commission within 30 days of the incident occurring. All \\u2018Priority 2\\u2019 incidents must be reported to the Commission within 30 days. are staff, contractors and volunteers employed or engaged by HHC Induction and staff training All workers must be familiar with the organisation\\u2019s incident management system, understand the organisation\\u2019s definition of Reportable Incidents, Priority 1 and Priority 2 incidents, and understand the procedures they must follow for reporting all incidents to the organisation and the Commission (if required). HHC promotes a culture of open reporting and ensures that all workers understand that they are supported to report any incident or alleged incident, and that there will be no negative consequences for doing so. Incident identification If a worker observes an incident, or a consumer or member of the public notifies a worker about an incident that does or could cause permanent or temporary detriment to a consumer, worker or other stakeholder, then the worker must report the incident to the Home Care Manager. Workers and consumers will be protected against any adverse actions as a result of reporting or alleging that an incident has occurred. Immediate response, and risk mitigation Where possible, an incident will first be addressed by the organisation\\u2019s personnel responsible and qualified to effectively manage the incident as it takes place. First responders understand that they must contact emergency services if the situation warrants. The principle is reduce harm, reduce risks and provide support. \\u2022 Reduce harm as much as possible (First aid) \\u2022 Reduce risks e.g. consider providing paid leave to distressed workers \\u2022 Provide support to those affected. Notification procedures Staff must report incidents to various agencies and persons based on the following priority system: \\u2022 For incidents of a serious nature workers must first contact emergency services. \\u2022 Workers must report all incidents and near misses internally to the Home Care Manager \\u2022 If it is determined that the incident is a Reportable Incident, the Home Care Manager is responsible for notifying families, guardians and advocates of the consumer. Incident Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 2|Page Incident Management Policy \\u2022 If an incident is a Reportable Incident, the Home Care Manager will determine whether it is a Priority 1 or Priority 2 incident (with the help of the Commission\\u2019s Decision Support Tool), and notify the Commission within the expected timeframe of the Commission. Reporting will be done through the My Aged Care Provider Portal. External Reporting 1) Police If HHC becomes aware of a Reportable Incident of a serious nature, it will be reported to police. This includes in cases: \\u2022 In which a Reportable Incident is only suspected or alleged to have occurred; \\u2022 Where there are reasonable grounds to notify police; or \\u2022 Where the Reportable Incident is criminal in nature. HHC will notify the consumer and/or their representative if an incident has been reported to the police. 2) Commission - Timeframes Unexplained absence from care will first be reported to the police, then to the Commission as soon as possible, and not later than 24 hours after the absence was reported to the police. All Priority 1 incidents will be reported, at a minimum, to the Commission in a two-stage process: \\u2022 Within 24 hours: incident notification to the Commission and reporting to police where necessary; and \\u2022 Within 5 business days: incident status report. All Priority 2 incidents will be reported to the Commission within 30 days of HHC either suspecting or becoming aware of the actual incident. HHC will respond promptly to any further questions from the Commission, and provide a final report if required by the Commission. If required by the Commission, a final report will be provided within 84 business days. The final report will include findings from investigative processes, as well as any additional details required by the Commission. If significant new information comes to light in relation to a Reportable Incident which has already been reported to the Commission, the Home Care Manager is responsible for informing the Commission as soon as possible, using the Commission-approved form. 3) Consider other Legislated/Mandatory Reporting requirements \\u2022 Practitioner Conduct: These may include legislated \\u2018mandatory reporting\\u2019 to AHPRA if there is concern about conduct regarding registered practitioners (see AHPRA guidance). NB consideration should be given for voluntary reports based on the nature of the incident to allow AHPRA to investigate. \\u2022 Privacy/Confidentiality: o Considerifthisrepresentsa\\u2018NotifiableDataBreach\\u2019fororganisationswhere turnover >$3million. o Formoreinformationsee\\u2018 \\u2022 Mandatory notifications for Workplace Injury include: o Thedeathofaperson o a\\u2018seriousinjuryorillness\\u2019,or Incident Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 3|Page Incident Management Policy o a\\u2018dangerousincident \\u00a7 See \\u2018Incident notification information sheet\\u2019 for more details and explanation of defintions and timeframes. \\u2022 Insurer where relevant \\u2022 Other o Considerthesituationandotherexternalnotificationsthatmayberequired. Supporting consumers Throughout the incident management process, from initial response through to review, consumers and others affected by an incident will be supported by the organisation through means of: \\u2022 Open Disclosure. The principles of incident management include where safe and appropriate to as much as possible advisie the consumer, following the principles of Open Disclosure. The Clinical Excellence Commission, NSW, STARS framework (attached) is often useful. \\u2022 Reassurance \\u2022 Trauma and counselling services where required; \\u2022 Changes to regular care and services if necessary; \\u2022 Consistent engagement with consumers and others affected by an incident, in line with the principles of open disclosure; and \\u2022 Clear, ongoing communication regarding the progress and outcomes of the investigation. Consumers and others affected by an incident will be involved in the management and resolution of the incident where appropriate. Consumers and other stakeholders will be informed of HHC\\u2019s incident management system, and will have access to this policy. Assessment and investigation The Home Care Manager is responsible for creating an initial assessment of any incident, to determine the severity of an incident and to establish the need for, and scope of, an investigation. If an incident is a Reportable Incident, an internal investigation will take place. All investigations will be undertaken and conducted in accordance with principles of natural justice and procedural fairness. Incidents involving criminal allegations will be reported to law enforcement, who will receive full support of the organisation in their investigations. Whenever an investigation into an incident is conducted, it should establish: \\u2022 The cause of the incident; \\u2022 The effect of the incident; \\u2022 Any organisational processes that contributed to or did not function in preventing the incident; \\u2022 Changes the organisation can make to prevent further incidents from occurring; \\u2022 What, if any, remedial action must be undertaken to prevent or minimise future incidents; and \\u2022 The effectiveness of HHC \\u2018s incident management system in relation to the incident. Information related to incident investigations, including records of phone conversations, emails, documents and, where possible, records of face-to-face interviews will be recorded and kept in strict confidence.

Implementing and monitoring corrective actions The Home Care Manager is responsible for implementing corrective quality and safety processes based on the findings of an incident investigation. The Home Care Manager is responsible for monitoring the outcomes of corrective quality and safety measures on a quarterly basis. Incident Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 5|Page Incident Management Policy Incident register and review including Committee Oversight The organisation keeps an accurate register of all incidents that occur in relation to the provision of services.

Code of Conduct for aged care and Ethical Behaviour Older people depend on us in varying capacities to maintain their well-being and live a quality life. We have the power to help them. Therefore, we need to be mindful to use our abilities to support older people and protect them from harm. We would do well to: 1. Act with respect for individual rights to freedom of expression, self-determination, and decision- making in accordance with relevant laws and conventions 2. Act in a way that treats people with dignity and respect, and values their diversity 3. Respect the privacy of everyone 4. Provide services in a safe and competent manner with care and skill 5. Act with integrity, honesty, and transparency 6. Promptly take steps to raise and act on concerns about matters that might have an impact on the quality and safety of services provided to people who are vulnerable 7. Provide care, supports and services free from: (i) all forms of violence, discrimination, exploitation, neglect and abuse (ii) sexual misconduct 8. Take all reasonable steps to prevent and respond to all forms of violence, exploitation, neglect, and abuse of people in our care Staff Handbook 1|Page Staff Handbook You can find out more about these behaviours in our Code of Ethical Conduct Policy \\u201cDear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.\\u201d Things to be mindful of Confidentiality 1 John 4:11 Often, we will learn things about clients other people will not know, either through conversations or reading documents. We need to remember to protect their confidentiality, and only share information to those who are also involved with their care. Before sharing any information, think about why you are sharing it. If it is necessary, be mindful to share only what needs to be known for that purpose. Also, think about whether you would like others talking about you in the same way. This applies to our colleagues and company information as well. Remember that we entrust each other with our information so that we can help meet each other\\u2019s needs. \\u201cDo not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen.\\u201d Ephesians 4:29 If you want to know more about this subject, you can access our Privacy Policy or talk to your manager about it. Safety, Security and Abuse When clients open their home to us, they are giving us a lot of power. We need to be mindful of this and use it responsibly. In everything we do or say, it\\u2019s important that we do so safely, as well as making them feel safe and secure. Abuse can occur when we come across as threatening, disrespectful; when we ignore their needs; when we touch them inappropriately; when we use physical force, or take advantage of their belongings, such as money. It is best that we treat our clients and colleagues with respect and humility. We need to show our concern for them by asking them if they feel safe and take actions if they say otherwise. \\u201cDo not devise harm against your neighbour, while he lives securely beside you.\\u201d Proverbs 3:29 If you want to find out more, you can refer to our Abuse and Neglect Policy or talk to your manager about it. Appearance Appearance can affect the comfort of clients we serve as well as what they think of the organisation. Therefore, we should always dress appropriately, being presentable, professional, clean, neat and tidy. All Care staff will be supplied with at least one HHC uniform shirt by the Office. Please use it and wash regularly. Appearance Guidelines Please follow the below guidelines: \\u2022 Identification badges should be worn to let clients know your name Staff Handbook 2|Page Staff Handbook \\u2022 In general, shoes should be sturdy, low heeled, protect the foot and have slip-resistant soles. We will wear shoe covers when we enter client\\u2019s homes. \\u2022 Uniforms are expected to be clean, tidy and not appear scrunched up. Hair When providing direct care, please tie your hair back if it is longer than shoulder length for hygiene purposes. Personal Items We should only be bringing what we need into the house. Consider bringing a small bag and keep it near the entrance of the home. This is to prevent suspicions of theft by the client. Try not to bring many personal items into the residence. Jewellery/Nails For safety purposes, when providing care, we should not wear rings (other than wedding bands), bracelets (other than medical alert bracelets), very long fingernails, nail polish, drop earrings and necklaces. Ear studs may be worn. This is to preserve the skin integrity of our clients and prevent unnecessary injury. Mobile phones We should generally refrain from using our mobile phones for personal reasons when working with a client. It is best to be kept in your bag so that you can pay attention to the client. If you are expecting an important call, notify the client in advance and minimise the time spent on the call. Smoking For the health and safety of our clients and colleagues, all working environments, including the client\\u2019s house and surrounds, are smoke-free. We encourage all staff to refrain from smoking whilst on shift and/or whilst travelling between clients. Hygiene and Infection Control Our clients can get very sick if they are infected with viruses or bacteria into their home. For the safety of them and us, we should keep ourselves clean and use personal protective equipment at appropriate times. This includes regular hand sanitisation, mask and glove wearing. You should always have these supplies with you. If you need to replenish them, please contact the office and we will arrange to deliver these to you. Please read the Infection Prevention and Control Policy and talk to your manager if you have any questions. Work Health and Safety Your health and safety are important to HHC. HHC is committed to the following: \\u2022 Regularly talk to you and ask you about work health and safety \\u2022 Develop safe procedures for everyone to use every day, including for emergencies \\u2022 Provide reporting systems and injury management What we need you to do is to: \\u2022 Use of the Home Safety Checklist at the client\\u2019s home before services start \\u2022 Take care for the safety of yourself and others Staff Handbook 3|Page Staff Handbook \\u2022 Comply with health and safety directions \\u2022 Report incidents and injury immediately \\u2022 Report and control hazards as you identify them, and report to management as needed Learning and Development We learn by experience and seeking answers to questions that come up in what we do each day. Therefore, HHC will actively encourage individual staff to reflect on the clients and services to identify opportunities for learning. We also organise group education sessions on topics that have been raised through client needs, staff requests and as required by industry standards or legislation. Employee relations Probation For Permanent or full-time staff, we generally provide a probationary period of 3 months, unless there is written notice from us to indicate otherwise. Payroll Enquiries Hope Holistic Care operates on a fortnightly pay cycle. Please contact the Office for any payroll enquiries Salary Packaging Hope Holistic Care is classified as a \\u201cpublic benevolent institution\\u201d (PBI). Therefore, it is able to offer full-time and part-time employees salary packaging \\u2013 reimbursing employees\\u2019 bills (tax free) up to $15,900 per annum. For more information, please contact the Office. Travel When visiting clients, the first trip to the client from your home and the last trip returning home will not be included in the mileage reimbursement. We will calculate the mileage for travel between the clients based on Google Maps and automatically pay you as travel allowance. If you assist the client with transportation or shopping during the visit, you will be able to report it in the app to claim reimbursement. Unless specified, there will not be any reimbursement for tolls paid during the travel to clients\\u2019 homes. Parking fines or any traffic infringements are not payable by HHC. Discrimination and Harassment Hope Holistic Care strives to maintain a working environment free from all forms of harassment or intimidation. Threatening, insulting or abusive words or behaviour towards another, or by displaying threatening, insulting or abusive words or pictures, unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favours and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature are serious violations of our policy and will not be condoned or permitted. HHC will not tolerate behaviour which is offensive, intimidating, humiliating, malicious, insulting or embarrassing and which is aimed at making an individual or group of individuals feel miserable, humiliated or lacking in self-confidence. It is expected that people in our workplace will behave in accordance with our Code of Ethical Behaviour. All reports of harassment, victimisation and bullying will be taken seriously, managed promptly and be treated with sensitivity and confidentiality. Staff Handbook 4|Page Staff Handbook Responsibilities Everyone is responsible to create and maintain a workplace environment that is free from any form of harassment. Managers and Supervisors Managers and supervisors must ensure that acceptable standards of behaviour are maintained in the workplace and have communicated the message that harassment will not be tolerated within the workplace. To meet these requirements, managers should: \\u2022 Ensure the work environment is free from discriminatory practices and unwelcome or offensive behaviour \\u2022 Treat harassment seriously, actively intervene and take early corrective action to deal with any behaviour or actions that may be considered inappropriate \\u2022 Handle any complaints in a fair, confidential and expeditious manner \\u2022 Ensure reprisal toward affected individuals does not occur \\u2022 Model appropriate behaviour \\u2022 Seek assistance from HR where there is any issue pertaining to harassment Staff Members and Volunteers All staff and volunteers are required to maintain acceptable standards of conduct and ensure that work is carried out in an environment free from all forms of harassment. All employees should: \\u2022 Reject immediately, any behaviour that is unwelcome and offensive \\u2022 Report any incident of harassment or bullying \\u2022 Not harass or bully, or participate in any behaviour that harasses or bullies other people Staff who become aware of harassment of others should: \\u2022 Advise their manager in the first instance \\u2022 Provide advice and assistance in making an informal or formal complaint \\u2022 Maintain confidentiality when providing information in an investigation Dispute and Grievance Settlement It is the responsibility of the organisation to provide you with the time, forums and mechanisms so you can tell us what you want us to hear. We encourage all employees to take responsibility for raising issues in a constructive way that will allow the organisation to acknowledge and take appropriate action. Any employee who believes that they have been unfairly treated, has the right to discuss the issue with their manager. Every manager within the organisation who has a grievance brought to their attention has the following obligations: \\u2022 To take the matter seriously \\u2022 To record the conversation and any agreed outcome \\u2022 To refer the matter to an appropriate person who can help the manager and employee resolve the issue In extreme circumstances, Hope Holistic Care may seek the assistance of an external qualified grievance management body to assist in resolving the matter. Staff Handbook 5|Page Staff Handbook A grievance should be lodged in writing and must identify the nature of the grievance, all of the persons involved, and the time and location in which the incident is reported to have arisen. Anonymous grievances will not be pursued by Hope Holistic Care. Senior management will treat all issues fairly, confidentially and without repercussions. False allegations are considered by Hope Holistic Care to be deliberate and wilful misconduct. Performance Management and Disciplinary Action The purpose of the performance management and disciplinary processes are to outline the steps that are required to be taken in order to resolve a performance management issue or a breach of terms and conditions of employment or organisation policy. This procedure is used to: \\u2022 Ensure fair treatment of staff at all times \\u2022 Establish a consistent approach to handling disciplinary matters \\u2022 Ensure that staff effort is channelled in the right direction \\u2022 Bring about a suitable change in any undesirable conduct/performance \\u2022 Prevent a situation of consistently unsatisfactory conduct/performance arising The purpose of counselling is to advise the staff member of any performance/conduct of concern and to establish if the organisation can provide assistance to avoid further instances of unacceptable performance/ conduct, whether through training, coaching or some other action. Summary Dismissal If you exhibit behaviour or engage in action that is either unlawful, negligent, or grossly offensive, you may be summarily dismissed. Examples include, but are not limited to: abuse, drug/alcohol abuse, misappropriation of funds, falsification of records, wilful refusal to obey reasonable directions and organisational policies/procedures.

This policy does not apply to grievances raised under the provisions of any applicable industrial instrument. 3 Definition A grievance is an unfair or unjust act or a wrongdoing that causes distress or notable discomfort to an employee or volunteer at work or within the work environment. 4 Policy HHC aims to foster good working relationships amongst employees and volunteers, however acknowledges that from time to time, problems arise at work that may cause employees, or volunteers to feel aggrieved. It is HHC\\u2019s policy that all investigation and disciplinary processes conducted at HHC will be managed in accordance with the relevant Award and/or legislation, and principles of natural justice. If an employee or volunteer is required to respond to allegations against them as part of the investigation process, or respond to concerns raised as part of a disciplinary process, the following will apply: - - - The employee or volunteer will be provided with an opportunity to respond to any allegations or concerns regarding their behaviour, including adequate notice to prepare their response, i.e. a minimum of 24 hours\\u2019 notice following written notification of an interview/disciplinary meeting. The employee or volunteer will be provided an opportunity to have an appropriate support person present at any interview / disciplinary meeting. Please note: colleagues will not be considered an appropriate support person if they are a witness or otherwise involved in the investigation / disciplinary process. A written record will be made of formal investigation interviews and disciplinary meetings with a copy being made available to the employee or volunteer as soon as practicable after the meeting. HHC\\u2019s policy is to encourage employees and volunteers to work towards resolving grievances by first discussing the issue with the relevant person / people. Where this fails to resolve the issue (or where the employee or volunteer has concerns about approaching the person / people directly), the employee or volunteer should refer to the Grievance Management Procedure which may lead to an investigation that will be conducted by an unbiased person who has experience and knowledge in dealing with grievance matters. Any investigation will be conducted in a fair, objective and timely manner with all relevant parties being informed of the investigation. Grievance Management Policy_POL_V01_2201 2|Page Grievance Management Policy 5 Impartiality The investigator responsible for handling the complaint is required to remain impartial during the process. This means are not to take sides, favour one party, or make presuppositions about the matter in the absence of the grievance being investigated. If the person handling the complaint considers they cannot remain impartial (for example, they are friends with one of the parties) they are to refer the complaint to the CEO. 6 Record Keeping and Confidentiality All records of any reported grievance and associated investigation, including any record as it relates to an issued warning as a result of the grievance is retained by the CEO. At all times during the grievance procedure, management and the CEO will maintain confidentiality as far as possible. Employees, and volunteers involved in the grievance, are required to maintain confidentiality. This means they are not permitted to talk to other employees or other volunteers about the grievance. 7 False Complaints If it is found that the complaint is vexatious, malicious or fabricated in any way, appropriate disciplinary action or counselling will be considered.

      "         \"Hello! If you've observed a bruise on a client's hand and neither the client nor the family knows how it happened, it is important to document and monitor the situation closely as part of your duty of care. According to the 'Incident Management Policy' document, you should follow these steps: Assessment and Investigation: The Home Care Manager is responsible for creating an initial assessment of the incident to determine the severity and establish the need for an investigation. If an incident is a Reportable Incident, an internal investigation will take place. Documenting the Incident: All relevant information and documentation related to investigations should be recorded and kept confidential, including details of any conversations, emails, documents, and where possible, records of face-to-face interviews. Monitoring: After recording the incident, it's essential to monitor the client for any changes or development of symptoms that may relate to the injury. This is to ensure that any further incidents are prevented and to provide adequate care for any complications that might arise from the initial bruise. It is also important to make sure that the injury is recorded in the client's medical record and that any further risk management strategies are discussed and implemented if necessary. You should refer to your organization\\u2019s specific protocols, as there may be additional local steps to take in such situations. If unsure, contact the Home Care Manager for further guidance on the proper course of action for documenting and monitoring injuries like bruises.

To support a client who got nauseous and had trouble controlling their bladder during a car ride home, you should refer to the 'HHC Staff Handbook' where it may have guidelines on health and safety, providing support to clients, and managing incidents. In general, to support the client, you can assure them that they are in a safe environment and that you are there to help. If possible, stop the car safely and assist the client in cleaning up or changing clothes if they have any spare. Provide them with water and help them to stay calm and comfortable. Use any supplies you might have in the car, such as towels or wet wipes; if you need supplies to be replenished, contact the office so they can arrange to deliver these to you. Record the incident according to your organization's policies and report it to your manager. After the incident, complete a Home Safety Checklist to ensure that the environment remains safe for both the client and staff. This guidance aims at maintaining the safety and dignity of the client while also ensuring that you are following the workplace's health and safety directives.

In the event that a client's appointment got rescheduled without prior knowledge, the best practice would be to communicate effectively to resolve the situation: Contact the Medical Practitioner's Office: As soon as you become aware of the scheduling issue, reach out to the client's medical practitioner's office to confirm the details of the rescheduling and gather information about the new appointment time and date. Inform the Client and/or Representative: Inform the client and their representative about the change as soon as possible to ensure they are aware and can make any necessary adjustments to their plans. Update Documentation: Ensure that all changes in appointment details are updated in the care documentation and that the care plan reflects this new information . Report the Incident: If applicable, report the scheduling issue to the Home Care Manager or management, as it may affect care planning or require further action. Review Policies and Procedures: After the situation is resolved, review the current policies and procedures to see if any improvements can be made to prevent similar issues in the future, such as double-checking appointment times or ensuring contact information is up to date .

      "         \"Hello! Care workers are expected to perform tasks within their defined scope of practice. Activities such as cleaning ceilings are not typically within the scope of care work and could pose safety and health risks. To ensure that care work is done safely and effectively, workers should follow these guidelines: Scope of Practice: Care workers should perform tasks that are outlined in their job descriptions and aligned with their training and qualifications. If a task like cleaning ceilings is outside of this scope, it is important for the care worker to communicate this to their supervisor or manager. Safety and Health Risks: Care workers should not be performing tasks that could jeopardize their health or safety or that of the clients. If a task seems unsafe or inappropriate, it should be discussed with a supervisor as soon as possible. Communication: Concerns about tasks that are outside a care worker's scope should be reported to management. The worker should clearly and promptly communicate their concerns to ensure that appropriate action can be taken. Policies and Procedures: The care worker should review the relevant policies and procedures regarding their scope of work and job duties. These policies should outline the expected tasks and steps to take if assigned tasks outside of this scope. For these reasons, a care worker performing tasks such as cleaning ceilings should discuss the matter with their immediate supervisor to clarify their responsibilities and duties. This will ensure that work is performed within the scope of practice and without compromising safety.

It is particularly common for older Australians living in aged care facilities to experience falls. Hope Holistic Care (HHC) is committed to taking necessary measures to prevent falls and fall-related harm from occurring in our facilities. We will ensure appropriate falls assessment, prevention and management strategies are effectively implemented. We will also ensure that workers are adequately trained on how to assess, identify and mitigate falls. Definitions Syncope (fainting): is a temporary loss of consciousness, often related to insufficient blood flow to the brain. Most commonly occurring when blood pressure is too low, and the heart doesn\\u2019t pump enough oxygen to the brain. Polypharmacy: is the concurrent use of multiple medications by a patient. Vestibular dysfunction: is a common cause of dizziness among the older population. Continence: is the ability of a person to control bowel and bladder movements. Procedures Risk Screening and Assessment HHC will conduct a screening and assessment of all clients in our facilities upon arrival and every six months. This falls risk screening process will be undertaken by a Registered Nurse and will include the following assessment from the best practice guidelines, to determine if the resident is a high or low falls risk. After determining the risk category of each client, an individualised management plan will be developed by Registered staff which outlines the main falls risks and mitigations strategies. The management plan will be used so that all staff are aware of the risks posed to each individual client, and any additional environmental or medical strategies which may need to be implemented. Syncope (fainting) All clients will be assessed for syncope on arrival at the facility. Presyncope, syncope and postural hypotension will be included when developing the client\\u2019s management plan for falls prevention. The root causes of clients who report having unexplained falls or episodes will be identified and addressed. Dizziness and vertigo Clients will be assessed for vestibular dysfunction if they experience dizziness, vertigo or imbalance. Vestibular rehabilitation will be implemented to treat dizziness and balance problems where indicated. Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 1|Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy Vision Clients will receive an eye examination on arrival to determine if they have cataracts. Clients who have severe visual impairments will receive visual aids if necessary, and their environment will be modified accordingly. Client participation HHC will ensure that clients are involved during the falls prevention processes. We will: \\u2022 provide information which frames falls prevention as a means for clients to remain independent for longer; \\u2022 provide information on \\u2018falls prevention\\u2019 to clients in a manner they understand; \\u2022 seek client input in discussions about preventing falls; \\u2022 develop falls prevention programs which accommodate the individual client\\u2019s needs; and \\u2022 identify potential barriers the client may face when taking part in actions to prevent falls. Staff training HHC\\u2019s Registered staff will be trained on how to undertake screening and assessment of new clients to determine if they are a high or low falls risk. The Registered staff will be trained on how to identify potential barriers or hazards which could result in falls and injury. The care staff responsible for assisting clients who wear hip-protectors will undertake relevant training on the correct application of hip protectors. Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 2|Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy Management Strategies Feet and footwear Clients\\u2019 footwear will be reviewed regularly to ensure it meets the safety guidelines. Clients will be encouraged to wear soft soled shoes as opposed to slippers. Clients will also be encouraged to wear footwear when walking, to avoid the increased risk of falling barefoot. The facility will, where possible, provide grip socks to all clients who present a high falls risk, to wear during the night. Clients will be offerreded to be referred to a podiatrist on arrival if they present with foot issues which require specialised attention, who may assist in falls prevention. Environmental considerations HHC will monitor the client\\u2019s environment and be attentive to feedback concerning near misses and recommend mitigation strategies where fall risks are identified, including to report to My Aged Care for reassessment to get assistance with Home modifications. Minimising injuries from falls Hip protectors will be given to clients who require them. HHC will consider the clients\\u2019 falls history, mobility, steadiness, gait, disability status, osteoporosis and body index when deciding whether to use hip-protectors. HHC will also ensure that clients who require assistance to use hip-protectors receive the necessary support. Restraints HHC will not apply restraints at anytime or under any circumstances. If a staff member is at risk of harm, they are advised to exit the client\\u2019s home to a safe place before reporting to the Case manager of office personnel. Observation HHC will work with the client and/or their representative to ensure that higher falls risk clients are closely observed, such as via regular phone calls. Clients with dementia and other clients who have a high risk of falling, will be encouraged to apply devices which can detect their falls and send responses to designated contacts. Continence Clients will also be offered continence assessments to check if they have problems that can be modified or prevented. Improving balance with mobility and exercise HHC will develop tailored physical activity and exercise programs for clients to help strengthen and improve stability, strength and mobility. HHC will assess balance, strength and mobility through a variety of tools and tests. These tests may include: - functional reach - six-metre walk - timed up-and-go - sit-to-stand - spring balance Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 3|Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy Medication management Case managers, Registered Staff and Care workers should be aware of the medications each client is taking and how those medications effect whether they are a high or low risk patient (e.g. knowing antidepressants are associated with higher risk of falls). HHC will encourage all clients who experience a fall have their medications reviewed by a pharmacist. Responding to Falls All clients who have a fall, will undergo a post-fall assessment taken by Registered staff. All falls will be documented and recorded by Registered staff. Responding to falls checklist No. 1 3 4 6 Item Tick when complete Offer basic support and provide immediate reassurance 2 Take baseline measures including: - pulse - blood pressure - respiratory rate - oxygen saturation - blood sugar levels - if client hit head \\u2013 record neurological observations and inform medical officer for further investigation. Check for injuries Move the client - assess whether it is safe to move them - use a lifting device and comply with lifting procedures 5 Monitor the resident: - for potential internal bleeding (if alcoholic or on blood thinning medications) - ensure continued monitoring of the resident in case injuries appear later Report the fall to a medical officer immediately. 7 Record the fall - include details on client\\u2019s medical record, location of fall, evidence of injury, response - type of fall - dependency of client on staff/aids - clothing, footwear and eyewear if relevant at time of fall - changes in medication - restraints used - observation at the time - contributing environmental factors - witnesses to the fall Discuss the fall and future risk management strategies 8 Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 4|Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy Client records HHC will ensure that all clients\\u2019 falls risk status and falls history is recorded in their client file/individualised management plan. Client files will be updated every six months, following reassessment of a client\\u2019s falls risk status, and any time a falls-related incident occurs.

      "         \"Policy HHC\\u2019s incident management system is consumer-centred, and focuses on the health, safety, wellbeing, and quality of life of consumers and anyone affected by an incident. Following an incident, HHC\\u2019s investigation and resolution processes are outcomes-focused and conducted in line with the principles of Open Disclosure. HHC is committed to ensuring that all incidents and near misses which occur in relation to the provision of services are managed consistently and effectively, and that workers can identify, manage, report and resolve incidents. The organisation collects and reviews data on incidents in order to inform improvement activities. HHC regularly reviews its incident management system and processes to ensure that they are: Well documented; Readily accessible to all workers employed or engaged by the organisation; Reflective and adaptive, with an intent to prevent incidents; and Compliant with the Serious Incident Response Scheme. Definitions Commission Incidents Reportable incidents refers to the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission are acts, omissions, events or circumstances that occur or could occur during or in relation to the provision of care and services, or the alteration or withdrawal of care and services, that cause harm, either physically or emotionally, to a worker, consumer, or other stakeholder. Incidents also include acts, omissions, events or circumstances that have caused or could cause damage to property, the environment, material or cause public alarm. are alleged, suspected or actual incidents which have occurred in connection with service delivery, where the person affected by the incident is a consumer, of severity that must be reported to the Commission. This includes but is not limited to: \\u2022 Unexpected death; \\u2022 Unexplained absence; \\u2022 Unreasonable use of force; \\u2022 Psychological or emotional abuse; \\u2022 Neglect; \\u2022 Unlawful or inappropriate sexual contact; \\u2022 Stealing or financial coercion by a staff member; and \\u2022 Inappropriate physical or chemical restraint. are Reportable Incidents of a higher level of harm than Priority 2 incidents and must be reported to the Commission within a more immediate timeframe. Priority 1 incidents include: \\u2022 Physical or psychological injury or illness requiring onsite medical or psychological treatment to resolve; \\u2022 Incidents where there are reasonable grounds to report the incident to police; or Priority 1 incidents Incident Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 1|Page Incident Management Policy Priority 2 incidents Workers Procedures \\u2022 A consumer\\u2019s unexpected death or a consumer\\u2019s unexplained absence from the service. All \\u2018Priority 1\\u2019 incidents must be reported to the Commission within 24 hours. are Reportable Incidents which are not Priority 1 incidents, and which result in a lower level of harm to a consumer, which must be reported to the Commission within 30 days of the incident occurring. All \\u2018Priority 2\\u2019 incidents must be reported to the Commission within 30 days. are staff, contractors and volunteers employed or engaged by HHC Induction and staff training All workers must be familiar with the organisation\\u2019s incident management system, understand the organisation\\u2019s definition of Reportable Incidents, Priority 1 and Priority 2 incidents, and understand the procedures they must follow for reporting all incidents to the organisation and the Commission (if required). HHC promotes a culture of open reporting and ensures that all workers understand that they are supported to report any incident or alleged incident, and that there will be no negative consequences for doing so. Incident identification If a worker observes an incident, or a consumer or member of the public notifies a worker about an incident that does or could cause permanent or temporary detriment to a consumer, worker or other stakeholder, then the worker must report the incident to the Home Care Manager. Workers and consumers will be protected against any adverse actions as a result of reporting or alleging that an incident has occurred. Immediate response, and risk mitigation Where possible, an incident will first be addressed by the organisation\\u2019s personnel responsible and qualified to effectively manage the incident as it takes place. First responders understand that they must contact emergency services if the situation warrants. The principle is reduce harm, reduce risks and provide support. \\u2022 Reduce harm as much as possible (First aid) \\u2022 Reduce risks e.g. consider providing paid leave to distressed workers \\u2022 Provide support to those affected. Notification procedures Staff must report incidents to various agencies and persons based on the following priority system: \\u2022 For incidents of a serious nature workers must first contact emergency services. \\u2022 Workers must report all incidents and near misses internally to the Home Care Manager \\u2022 If it is determined that the incident is a Reportable Incident, the Home Care Manager is responsible for notifying families, guardians and advocates of the consumer. Incident Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 2|Page Incident Management Policy \\u2022 If an incident is a Reportable Incident, the Home Care Manager will determine whether it is a Priority 1 or Priority 2 incident (with the help of the Commission\\u2019s Decision Support Tool), and notify the Commission within the expected timeframe of the Commission. Reporting will be done through the My Aged Care Provider Portal. External Reporting 1) Police If HHC becomes aware of a Reportable Incident of a serious nature, it will be reported to police. This includes in cases: \\u2022 In which a Reportable Incident is only suspected or alleged to have occurred; \\u2022 Where there are reasonable grounds to notify police; or \\u2022 Where the Reportable Incident is criminal in nature. HHC will notify the consumer and/or their representative if an incident has been reported to the police. 2) Commission - Timeframes Unexplained absence from care will first be reported to the police, then to the Commission as soon as possible, and not later than 24 hours after the absence was reported to the police. All Priority 1 incidents will be reported, at a minimum, to the Commission in a two-stage process: \\u2022 Within 24 hours: incident notification to the Commission and reporting to police where necessary; and \\u2022 Within 5 business days: incident status report. All Priority 2 incidents will be reported to the Commission within 30 days of HHC either suspecting or becoming aware of the actual incident. HHC will respond promptly to any further questions from the Commission, and provide a final report if required by the Commission. If required by the Commission, a final report will be provided within 84 business days. The final report will include findings from investigative processes, as well as any additional details required by the Commission. If significant new information comes to light in relation to a Reportable Incident which has already been reported to the Commission, the Home Care Manager is responsible for informing the Commission as soon as possible, using the Commission-approved form. 3) Consider other Legislated/Mandatory Reporting requirements \\u2022 Practitioner Conduct: These may include legislated \\u2018mandatory reporting\\u2019 to AHPRA if there is concern about conduct regarding registered practitioners (see AHPRA guidance).

Supporting consumers Throughout the incident management process, from initial response through to review, consumers and others affected by an incident will be supported by the organisation through means of: \\u2022 Open Disclosure. The principles of incident management include where safe and appropriate to as much as possible advisie the consumer, following the principles of Open Disclosure. The Clinical Excellence Commission, NSW, STARS framework (attached) is often useful. \\u2022 Reassurance \\u2022 Trauma and counselling services where required; \\u2022 Changes to regular care and services if necessary; \\u2022 Consistent engagement with consumers and others affected by an incident, in line with the principles of open disclosure; and \\u2022 Clear, ongoing communication regarding the progress and outcomes of the investigation. Consumers and others affected by an incident will be involved in the management and resolution of the incident where appropriate. Consumers and other stakeholders will be informed of HHC\\u2019s incident management system, and will have access to this policy. Assessment and investigation The Home Care Manager is responsible for creating an initial assessment of any incident, to determine the severity of an incident and to establish the need for, and scope of, an investigation. If an incident is a Reportable Incident, an internal investigation will take place.

      "         \"Policy HHC\\u2019s incident management system is consumer-centred, and focuses on the health, safety, wellbeing, and quality of life of consumers and anyone affected by an incident. Following an incident, HHC\\u2019s investigation and resolution processes are outcomes-focused and conducted in line with the principles of Open Disclosure. HHC is committed to ensuring that all incidents and near misses which occur in relation to the provision of services are managed consistently and effectively, and that workers can identify, manage, report and resolve incidents. The organisation collects and reviews data on incidents in order to inform improvement activities. HHC regularly reviews its incident management system and processes to ensure that they are: Well documented; Readily accessible to all workers employed or engaged by the organisation; Reflective and adaptive, with an intent to prevent incidents; and Compliant with the Serious Incident Response Scheme. Definitions Commission Incidents Reportable incidents refers to the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission are acts, omissions, events or circumstances that occur or could occur during or in relation to the provision of care and services, or the alteration or withdrawal of care and services, that cause harm, either physically or emotionally, to a worker, consumer, or other stakeholder. Incidents also include acts, omissions, events or circumstances that have caused or could cause damage to property, the environment, material or cause public alarm. are alleged, suspected or actual incidents which have occurred in connection with service delivery, where the person affected by the incident is a consumer, of severity that must be reported to the Commission. This includes but is not limited to: \\u2022 Unexpected death; \\u2022 Unexplained absence; \\u2022 Unreasonable use of force; \\u2022 Psychological or emotional abuse; \\u2022 Neglect; \\u2022 Unlawful or inappropriate sexual contact; \\u2022 Stealing or financial coercion by a staff member; and \\u2022 Inappropriate physical or chemical restraint. are Reportable Incidents of a higher level of harm than Priority 2 incidents and must be reported to the Commission within a more immediate timeframe. Priority 1 incidents include: \\u2022 Physical or psychological injury or illness requiring onsite medical or psychological treatment to resolve; \\u2022 Incidents where there are reasonable grounds to report the incident to police; or Priority 1 incidents Incident Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 1|Page Incident Management Policy Priority 2 incidents Workers Procedures \\u2022 A consumer\\u2019s unexpected death or a consumer\\u2019s unexplained absence from the service. All \\u2018Priority 1\\u2019 incidents must be reported to the Commission within 24 hours. are Reportable Incidents which are not Priority 1 incidents, and which result in a lower level of harm to a consumer, which must be reported to the Commission within 30 days of the incident occurring. All \\u2018Priority 2\\u2019 incidents must be reported to the Commission within 30 days. are staff, contractors and volunteers employed or engaged by HHC Induction and staff training All workers must be familiar with the organisation\\u2019s incident management system, understand the organisation\\u2019s definition of Reportable Incidents, Priority 1 and Priority 2 incidents, and understand the procedures they must follow for reporting all incidents to the organisation and the Commission (if required). HHC promotes a culture of open reporting and ensures that all workers understand that they are supported to report any incident or alleged incident, and that there will be no negative consequences for doing so. Incident identification If a worker observes an incident, or a consumer or member of the public notifies a worker about an incident that does or could cause permanent or temporary detriment to a consumer, worker or other stakeholder, then the worker must report the incident to the Home Care Manager. Workers and consumers will be protected against any adverse actions as a result of reporting or alleging that an incident has occurred. Immediate response, and risk mitigation Where possible, an incident will first be addressed by the organisation\\u2019s personnel responsible and qualified to effectively manage the incident as it takes place. First responders understand that they must contact emergency services if the situation warrants. The principle is reduce harm, reduce risks and provide support. \\u2022 Reduce harm as much as possible (First aid) \\u2022 Reduce risks e.g. consider providing paid leave to distressed workers \\u2022 Provide support to those affected. Notification procedures Staff must report incidents to various agencies and persons based on the following priority system: \\u2022 For incidents of a serious nature workers must first contact emergency services. \\u2022 Workers must report all incidents and near misses internally to the Home Care Manager \\u2022 If it is determined that the incident is a Reportable Incident, the Home Care Manager is responsible for notifying families, guardians and advocates of the consumer. Incident Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 2|Page Incident Management Policy \\u2022 If an incident is a Reportable Incident, the Home Care Manager will determine whether it is a Priority 1 or Priority 2 incident (with the help of the Commission\\u2019s Decision Support Tool), and notify the Commission within the expected timeframe of the Commission. Reporting will be done through the My Aged Care Provider Portal. External Reporting 1) Police If HHC becomes aware of a Reportable Incident of a serious nature, it will be reported to police. This includes in cases: \\u2022 In which a Reportable Incident is only suspected or alleged to have occurred; \\u2022 Where there are reasonable grounds to notify police; or \\u2022 Where the Reportable Incident is criminal in nature. HHC will notify the consumer and/or their representative if an incident has been reported to the police. 2) Commission - Timeframes Unexplained absence from care will first be reported to the police, then to the Commission as soon as possible, and not later than 24 hours after the absence was reported to the police. All Priority 1 incidents will be reported, at a minimum, to the Commission in a two-stage process: \\u2022 Within 24 hours: incident notification to the Commission and reporting to police where necessary; and \\u2022 Within 5 business days: incident status report. All Priority 2 incidents will be reported to the Commission within 30 days of HHC either suspecting or becoming aware of the actual incident. HHC will respond promptly to any further questions from the Commission, and provide a final report if required by the Commission. If required by the Commission, a final report will be provided within 84 business days. The final report will include findings from investigative processes, as well as any additional details required by the Commission. If significant new information comes to light in relation to a Reportable Incident which has already been reported to the Commission, the Home Care Manager is responsible for informing the Commission as soon as possible, using the Commission-approved form. 3) Consider other Legislated/Mandatory Reporting requirements \\u2022 Practitioner Conduct: These may include legislated \\u2018mandatory reporting\\u2019 to AHPRA if there is concern about conduct regarding registered practitioners (see AHPRA guidance).

HHC will maintain a Feedback and Complaints Resolution System, to ensure that all feedback and complaints are considered and resolved in a timely and impartial fashion. HHC will maintain a register of all feedback and complaints information, that will provide transparency regarding how feedback and complaints are managed. This register will be centrally managed by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO).

Should there be three requests from the same client regarding similar matters of a dissatisfactory nature within a 3 month period, the request will be treated as a complaint. HHC will address all complaints in a confidential manner. Only the people directly involved in making, investigating or resolving a complaint will have access to the information. Complainants may make complaints anonymously if desired. HHC will ensure the complaints resolution process: \\u2022 commences within 48 hours of receipt of the complaint (this includes contacting the complainant), with an investigation and response to the complainant being completed within 21 working days of receipt of the complaint; \\u2022 is fair and impartial, and follows \\u2018Procedural Fairness\\u2019 rules; \\u2022 involves the complainant, and any other parties affected by the complaint, in the resolution of the complaint, as far as is reasonably practicable; \\u2022 makes appropriate support and assistance available to the complainant, throughout the complaint process.

Please let us know of changes at least 2 weeks or more in advance. Assigning client services When a client service is assigned to you, our office team will give you some background on the client so that you know what to expect.

Code of Conduct for aged care and Ethical Behaviour Older people depend on us in varying capacities to maintain their well-being and live a quality life. We have the power to help them. Therefore, we need to be mindful to use our abilities to support older people and protect them from harm. We would do well to: 1. Act with respect for individual rights to freedom of expression, self-determination, and decision- making in accordance with relevant laws and conventions 2. Act in a way that treats people with dignity and respect, and values their diversity 3. Respect the privacy of everyone 4. Provide services in a safe and competent manner with care and skill 5. Act with integrity, honesty, and transparency 6. Promptly take steps to raise and act on concerns about matters that might have an impact on the quality and safety of services provided to people who are vulnerable 7. Provide care, supports and services free from: (i) all forms of violence, discrimination, exploitation, neglect and abuse (ii) sexual misconduct 8. Take all reasonable steps to prevent and respond to all forms of violence, exploitation, neglect, and abuse of people in our care Staff Handbook 1|Page Staff Handbook You can find out more about these behaviours in our Code of Ethical Conduct Policy \\u201cDear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.\\u201d Things to be mindful of Confidentiality 1 John 4:11 Often, we will learn things about clients other people will not know, either through conversations or reading documents. We need to remember to protect their confidentiality, and only share information to those who are also involved with their care. Before sharing any information, think about why you are sharing it. If it is necessary, be mindful to share only what needs to be known for that purpose. Also, think about whether you would like others talking about you in the same way. This applies to our colleagues and company information as well. Remember that we entrust each other with our information so that we can help meet each other\\u2019s needs. \\u201cDo not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen.\\u201d Ephesians 4:29 If you want to know more about this subject, you can access our Privacy Policy or talk to your manager about it. Safety, Security and Abuse When clients open their home to us, they are giving us a lot of power. We need to be mindful of this and use it responsibly. In everything we do or say, it\\u2019s important that we do so safely, as well as making them feel safe and secure. Abuse can occur when we come across as threatening, disrespectful; when we ignore their needs; when we touch them inappropriately; when we use physical force, or take advantage of their belongings, such as money. It is best that we treat our clients and colleagues with respect and humility. We need to show our concern for them by asking them if they feel safe and take actions if they say otherwise. \\u201cDo not devise harm against your neighbour, while he lives securely beside you.\\u201d Proverbs 3:29 If you want to find out more, you can refer to our Abuse and Neglect Policy or talk to your manager about it. Appearance Appearance can affect the comfort of clients we serve as well as what they think of the organisation. Therefore, we should always dress appropriately, being presentable, professional, clean, neat and tidy. All Care staff will be supplied with at least one HHC uniform shirt by the Office. Please use it and wash regularly. Appearance Guidelines Please follow the below guidelines: \\u2022 Identification badges should be worn to let clients know your name Staff Handbook 2|Page Staff Handbook \\u2022 In general, shoes should be sturdy, low heeled, protect the foot and have slip-resistant soles. We will wear shoe covers when we enter client\\u2019s homes. \\u2022 Uniforms are expected to be clean, tidy and not appear scrunched up. Hair When providing direct care, please tie your hair back if it is longer than shoulder length for hygiene purposes. Personal Items We should only be bringing what we need into the house. Consider bringing a small bag and keep it near the entrance of the home. This is to prevent suspicions of theft by the client. Try not to bring many personal items into the residence. Jewellery/Nails For safety purposes, when providing care, we should not wear rings (other than wedding bands), bracelets (other than medical alert bracelets), very long fingernails, nail polish, drop earrings and necklaces. Ear studs may be worn. This is to preserve the skin integrity of our clients and prevent unnecessary injury. Mobile phones We should generally refrain from using our mobile phones for personal reasons when working with a client. It is best to be kept in your bag so that you can pay attention to the client. If you are expecting an important call, notify the client in advance and minimise the time spent on the call. Smoking For the health and safety of our clients and colleagues, all working environments, including the client\\u2019s house and surrounds, are smoke-free. We encourage all staff to refrain from smoking whilst on shift and/or whilst travelling between clients. Hygiene and Infection Control Our clients can get very sick if they are infected with viruses or bacteria into their home. For the safety of them and us, we should keep ourselves clean and use personal protective equipment at appropriate times. This includes regular hand sanitisation, mask and glove wearing. You should always have these supplies with you. If you need to replenish them, please contact the office and we will arrange to deliver these to you. Please read the Infection Prevention and Control Policy and talk to your manager if you have any questions. Work Health and Safety Your health and safety are important to HHC. HHC is committed to the following: \\u2022 Regularly talk to you and ask you about work health and safety \\u2022 Develop safe procedures for everyone to use every day, including for emergencies \\u2022 Provide reporting systems and injury management What we need you to do is to: \\u2022 Use of the Home Safety Checklist at the client\\u2019s home before services start \\u2022 Take care for the safety of yourself and others Staff Handbook 3|Page Staff Handbook \\u2022 Comply with health and safety directions \\u2022 Report incidents and injury immediately \\u2022 Report and control hazards as you identify them, and report to management as needed Learning and Development We learn by experience and seeking answers to questions that come up in what we do each day. Therefore, HHC will actively encourage individual staff to reflect on the clients and services to identify opportunities for learning. We also organise group education sessions on topics that have been raised through client needs, staff requests and as required by industry standards or legislation. Employee relations Probation For Permanent or full-time staff, we generally provide a probationary period of 3 months, unless there is written notice from us to indicate otherwise. Payroll Enquiries Hope Holistic Care operates on a fortnightly pay cycle. Please contact the Office for any payroll enquiries Salary Packaging Hope Holistic Care is classified as a \\u201cpublic benevolent institution\\u201d (PBI). Therefore, it is able to offer full-time and part-time employees salary packaging \\u2013 reimbursing employees\\u2019 bills (tax free) up to $15,900 per annum. For more information, please contact the Office. Travel When visiting clients, the first trip to the client from your home and the last trip returning home will not be included in the mileage reimbursement. We will calculate the mileage for travel between the clients based on Google Maps and automatically pay you as travel allowance. If you assist the client with transportation or shopping during the visit, you will be able to report it in the app to claim reimbursement. Unless specified, there will not be any reimbursement for tolls paid during the travel to clients\\u2019 homes. Parking fines or any traffic infringements are not payable by HHC. Discrimination and Harassment Hope Holistic Care strives to maintain a working environment free from all forms of harassment or intimidation. Threatening, insulting or abusive words or behaviour towards another, or by displaying threatening, insulting or abusive words or pictures, unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favours and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature are serious violations of our policy and will not be condoned or permitted. HHC will not tolerate behaviour which is offensive, intimidating, humiliating, malicious, insulting or embarrassing and which is aimed at making an individual or group of individuals feel miserable, humiliated or lacking in self-confidence. It is expected that people in our workplace will behave in accordance with our Code of Ethical Behaviour. All reports of harassment, victimisation and bullying will be taken seriously, managed promptly and be treated with sensitivity and confidentiality. Staff Handbook 4|Page Staff Handbook Responsibilities Everyone is responsible to create and maintain a workplace environment that is free from any form of harassment. Managers and Supervisors Managers and supervisors must ensure that acceptable standards of behaviour are maintained in the workplace and have communicated the message that harassment will not be tolerated within the workplace. To meet these requirements, managers should: \\u2022 Ensure the work environment is free from discriminatory practices and unwelcome or offensive behaviour \\u2022 Treat harassment seriously, actively intervene and take early corrective action to deal with any behaviour or actions that may be considered inappropriate \\u2022 Handle any complaints in a fair, confidential and expeditious manner \\u2022 Ensure reprisal toward affected individuals does not occur \\u2022 Model appropriate behaviour \\u2022 Seek assistance from HR where there is any issue pertaining to harassment Staff Members and Volunteers All staff and volunteers are required to maintain acceptable standards of conduct and ensure that work is carried out in an environment free from all forms of harassment. All employees should: \\u2022 Reject immediately, any behaviour that is unwelcome and offensive \\u2022 Report any incident of harassment or bullying \\u2022 Not harass or bully, or participate in any behaviour that harasses or bullies other people Staff who become aware of harassment of others should: \\u2022 Advise their manager in the first instance \\u2022 Provide advice and assistance in making an informal or formal complaint \\u2022 Maintain confidentiality when providing information in an investigation Dispute and Grievance Settlement It is the responsibility of the organisation to provide you with the time, forums and mechanisms so you can tell us what you want us to hear. We encourage all employees to take responsibility for raising issues in a constructive way that will allow the organisation to acknowledge and take appropriate action. Any employee who believes that they have been unfairly treated, has the right to discuss the issue with their manager. Every manager within the organisation who has a grievance brought to their attention has the following obligations: \\u2022 To take the matter seriously \\u2022 To record the conversation and any agreed outcome \\u2022 To refer the matter to an appropriate person who can help the manager and employee resolve the issue In extreme circumstances, Hope Holistic Care may seek the assistance of an external qualified grievance management body to assist in resolving the matter. Staff Handbook 5|Page Staff Handbook A grievance should be lodged in writing and must identify the nature of the grievance, all of the persons involved, and the time and location in which the incident is reported to have arisen. Anonymous grievances will not be pursued by Hope Holistic Care. Senior management will treat all issues fairly, confidentially and without repercussions. False allegations are considered by Hope Holistic Care to be deliberate and wilful misconduct. Performance Management and Disciplinary Action The purpose of the performance management and disciplinary processes are to outline the steps that are required to be taken in order to resolve a performance management issue or a breach of terms and conditions of employment or organisation policy. This procedure is used to: \\u2022 Ensure fair treatment of staff at all times \\u2022 Establish a consistent approach to handling disciplinary matters \\u2022 Ensure that staff effort is channelled in the right direction \\u2022 Bring about a suitable change in any undesirable conduct/performance \\u2022 Prevent a situation of consistently unsatisfactory conduct/performance arising The purpose of counselling is to advise the staff member of any performance/conduct of concern and to establish if the organisation can provide assistance to avoid further instances of unacceptable performance/ conduct, whether through training, coaching or some other action. Summary Dismissal If you exhibit behaviour or engage in action that is either unlawful, negligent, or grossly offensive, you may be summarily dismissed. Examples include, but are not limited to: abuse, drug/alcohol abuse, misappropriation of funds, falsification of records, wilful refusal to obey reasonable directions and organisational policies/procedures.

HHC regularly reviews its incident management system and processes to ensure that they are: Well documented; Readily accessible to all workers employed or engaged by the organisation; Reflective and adaptive, with an intent to prevent incidents; and Compliant with the Serious Incident Response Scheme. Definitions Commission Incidents Reportable incidents refers to the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission are acts, omissions, events or circumstances that occur or could occur during or in relation to the provision of care and services, or the alteration or withdrawal of care and services, that cause harm, either physically or emotionally, to a worker, consumer, or other stakeholder. Incidents also include acts, omissions, events or circumstances that have caused or could cause damage to property, the environment, material or cause public alarm. are alleged, suspected or actual incidents which have occurred in connection with service delivery, where the person affected by the incident is a consumer, of severity that must be reported to the Commission. This includes but is not limited to: \\u2022 Unexpected death; \\u2022 Unexplained absence; \\u2022 Unreasonable use of force; \\u2022 Psychological or emotional abuse; \\u2022 Neglect; \\u2022 Unlawful or inappropriate sexual contact; \\u2022 Stealing or financial coercion by a staff member; and \\u2022 Inappropriate physical or chemical restraint. are Reportable Incidents of a higher level of harm than Priority 2 incidents and must be reported to the Commission within a more immediate timeframe. Priority 1 incidents include: \\u2022 Physical or psychological injury or illness requiring onsite medical or psychological treatment to resolve; \\u2022 Incidents where there are reasonable grounds to report the incident to police; or Priority 1 incidents Incident Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 1|Page Incident Management Policy Priority 2 incidents Workers Procedures \\u2022 A consumer\\u2019s unexpected death or a consumer\\u2019s unexplained absence from the service. All \\u2018Priority 1\\u2019 incidents must be reported to the Commission within 24 hours. are Reportable Incidents which are not Priority 1 incidents, and which result in a lower level of harm to a consumer, which must be reported to the Commission within 30 days of the incident occurring. All \\u2018Priority 2\\u2019 incidents must be reported to the Commission within 30 days. are staff, contractors and volunteers employed or engaged by HHC Induction and staff training All workers must be familiar with the organisation\\u2019s incident management system, understand the organisation\\u2019s definition of Reportable Incidents, Priority 1 and Priority 2 incidents, and understand the procedures they must follow for reporting all incidents to the organisation and the Commission (if required). HHC promotes a culture of open reporting and ensures that all workers understand that they are supported to report any incident or alleged incident, and that there will be no negative consequences for doing so. Incident identification If a worker observes an incident, or a consumer or member of the public notifies a worker about an incident that does or could cause permanent or temporary detriment to a consumer, worker or other stakeholder, then the worker must report the incident to the Home Care Manager. Workers and consumers will be protected against any adverse actions as a result of reporting or alleging that an incident has occurred. Immediate response, and risk mitigation Where possible, an incident will first be addressed by the organisation\\u2019s personnel responsible and qualified to effectively manage the incident as it takes place. First responders understand that they must contact emergency services if the situation warrants. The principle is reduce harm, reduce risks and provide support. \\u2022 Reduce harm as much as possible (First aid) \\u2022 Reduce risks e.g. consider providing paid leave to distressed workers \\u2022 Provide support to those affected. Notification procedures Staff must report incidents to various agencies and persons based on the following priority system: \\u2022 For incidents of a serious nature workers must first contact emergency services. \\u2022 Workers must report all incidents and near misses internally to the Home Care Manager \\u2022 If it is determined that the incident is a Reportable Incident, the Home Care Manager is responsible for notifying families, guardians and advocates of the consumer. Incident Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 2|Page Incident Management Policy \\u2022 If an incident is a Reportable Incident, the Home Care Manager will determine whether it is a Priority 1 or Priority 2 incident (with the help of the Commission\\u2019s Decision Support Tool), and notify the Commission within the expected timeframe of the Commission. Reporting will be done through the My Aged Care Provider Portal. External Reporting 1) Police If HHC becomes aware of a Reportable Incident of a serious nature, it will be reported to police. This includes in cases: \\u2022 In which a Reportable Incident is only suspected or alleged to have occurred; \\u2022 Where there are reasonable grounds to notify police; or \\u2022 Where the Reportable Incident is criminal in nature. HHC will notify the consumer and/or their representative if an incident has been reported to the police. 2) Commission - Timeframes Unexplained absence from care will first be reported to the police, then to the Commission as soon as possible, and not later than 24 hours after the absence was reported to the police. All Priority 1 incidents will be reported, at a minimum, to the Commission in a two-stage process: \\u2022 Within 24 hours: incident notification to the Commission and reporting to police where necessary; and \\u2022 Within 5 business days: incident status report. All Priority 2 incidents will be reported to the Commission within 30 days of HHC either suspecting or becoming aware of the actual incident. HHC will respond promptly to any further questions from the Commission, and provide a final report if required by the Commission. If required by the Commission, a final report will be provided within 84 business days. The final report will include findings from investigative processes, as well as any additional details required by the Commission. If significant new information comes to light in relation to a Reportable Incident which has already been reported to the Commission, the Home Care Manager is responsible for informing the Commission as soon as possible, using the Commission-approved form. 3) Consider other Legislated/Mandatory Reporting requirements \\u2022 Practitioner Conduct: These may include legislated \\u2018mandatory reporting\\u2019 to AHPRA if there is concern about conduct regarding registered practitioners (see AHPRA guidance). NB consideration should be given for voluntary reports based on the nature of the incident to allow AHPRA to investigate. \\u2022 Privacy/Confidentiality: o Considerifthisrepresentsa\\u2018NotifiableDataBreach\\u2019fororganisationswhere turnover >$3million. o Formoreinformationsee\\u2018 \\u2022 Mandatory notifications for Workplace Injury include: o Thedeathofaperson o a\\u2018seriousinjuryorillness\\u2019,or Incident Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 3|Page Incident Management Policy o a\\u2018dangerousincident \\u00a7 See \\u2018Incident notification information sheet\\u2019 for more details and explanation of defintions and timeframes. \\u2022 Insurer where relevant \\u2022 Other o Considerthesituationandotherexternalnotificationsthatmayberequired. Supporting consumers Throughout the incident management process, from initial response through to review, consumers and others affected by an incident will be supported by the organisation through means of: \\u2022 Open Disclosure. The principles of incident management include where safe and appropriate to as much as possible advisie the consumer, following the principles of Open Disclosure.

Consumers and others affected by an incident will be involved in the management and resolution of the incident where appropriate. Consumers and other stakeholders will be informed of HHC\\u2019s incident management system, and will have access to this policy. Assessment and investigation The Home Care Manager is responsible for creating an initial assessment of any incident, to determine the severity of an incident and to establish the need for, and scope of, an investigation. If an incident is a Reportable Incident, an internal investigation will take place. All investigations will be undertaken and conducted in accordance with principles of natural justice and procedural fairness. Incidents involving criminal allegations will be reported to law enforcement, who will receive full support of the organisation in their investigations. Whenever an investigation into an incident is conducted, it should establish: \\u2022 The cause of the incident; \\u2022 The effect of the incident; \\u2022 Any organisational processes that contributed to or did not function in preventing the incident; \\u2022 Changes the organisation can make to prevent further incidents from occurring; \\u2022 What, if any, remedial action must be undertaken to prevent or minimise future incidents; and \\u2022 The effectiveness of HHC \\u2018s incident management system in relation to the incident. Information related to incident investigations, including records of phone conversations, emails, documents and, where possible, records of face-to-face interviews will be recorded and kept in strict confidence.

It is particularly common for older Australians living in aged care facilities to experience falls. Hope Holistic Care (HHC) is committed to taking necessary measures to prevent falls and fall-related harm from occurring in our facilities. We will ensure appropriate falls assessment, prevention and management strategies are effectively implemented. We will also ensure that workers are adequately trained on how to assess, identify and mitigate falls. Definitions Syncope (fainting): is a temporary loss of consciousness, often related to insufficient blood flow to the brain. Most commonly occurring when blood pressure is too low, and the heart doesn\\u2019t pump enough oxygen to the brain. Polypharmacy: is the concurrent use of multiple medications by a patient. Vestibular dysfunction: is a common cause of dizziness among the older population. Continence: is the ability of a person to control bowel and bladder movements. Procedures Risk Screening and Assessment HHC will conduct a screening and assessment of all clients in our facilities upon arrival and every six months. This falls risk screening process will be undertaken by a Registered Nurse and will include the following assessment from the best practice guidelines, to determine if the resident is a high or low falls risk. After determining the risk category of each client, an individualised management plan will be developed by Registered staff which outlines the main falls risks and mitigations strategies. The management plan will be used so that all staff are aware of the risks posed to each individual client, and any additional environmental or medical strategies which may need to be implemented. Syncope (fainting) All clients will be assessed for syncope on arrival at the facility. Presyncope, syncope and postural hypotension will be included when developing the client\\u2019s management plan for falls prevention. The root causes of clients who report having unexplained falls or episodes will be identified and addressed. Dizziness and vertigo Clients will be assessed for vestibular dysfunction if they experience dizziness, vertigo or imbalance. Vestibular rehabilitation will be implemented to treat dizziness and balance problems where indicated. Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 1|Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy Vision Clients will receive an eye examination on arrival to determine if they have cataracts. Clients who have severe visual impairments will receive visual aids if necessary, and their environment will be modified accordingly. Client participation HHC will ensure that clients are involved during the falls prevention processes. We will: \\u2022 provide information which frames falls prevention as a means for clients to remain independent for longer; \\u2022 provide information on \\u2018falls prevention\\u2019 to clients in a manner they understand; \\u2022 seek client input in discussions about preventing falls; \\u2022 develop falls prevention programs which accommodate the individual client\\u2019s needs; and \\u2022 identify potential barriers the client may face when taking part in actions to prevent falls. Staff training HHC\\u2019s Registered staff will be trained on how to undertake screening and assessment of new clients to determine if they are a high or low falls risk. The Registered staff will be trained on how to identify potential barriers or hazards which could result in falls and injury. The care staff responsible for assisting clients who wear hip-protectors will undertake relevant training on the correct application of hip protectors. Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 2|Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy Management Strategies Feet and footwear Clients\\u2019 footwear will be reviewed regularly to ensure it meets the safety guidelines. Clients will be encouraged to wear soft soled shoes as opposed to slippers. Clients will also be encouraged to wear footwear when walking, to avoid the increased risk of falling barefoot. The facility will, where possible, provide grip socks to all clients who present a high falls risk, to wear during the night. Clients will be offerreded to be referred to a podiatrist on arrival if they present with foot issues which require specialised attention, who may assist in falls prevention. Environmental considerations HHC will monitor the client\\u2019s environment and be attentive to feedback concerning near misses and recommend mitigation strategies where fall risks are identified, including to report to My Aged Care for reassessment to get assistance with Home modifications. Minimising injuries from falls Hip protectors will be given to clients who require them. HHC will consider the clients\\u2019 falls history, mobility, steadiness, gait, disability status, osteoporosis and body index when deciding whether to use hip-protectors. HHC will also ensure that clients who require assistance to use hip-protectors receive the necessary support. Restraints HHC will not apply restraints at anytime or under any circumstances. If a staff member is at risk of harm, they are advised to exit the client\\u2019s home to a safe place before reporting to the Case manager of office personnel. Observation HHC will work with the client and/or their representative to ensure that higher falls risk clients are closely observed, such as via regular phone calls. Clients with dementia and other clients who have a high risk of falling, will be encouraged to apply devices which can detect their falls and send responses to designated contacts. Continence Clients will also be offered continence assessments to check if they have problems that can be modified or prevented. Improving balance with mobility and exercise HHC will develop tailored physical activity and exercise programs for clients to help strengthen and improve stability, strength and mobility. HHC will assess balance, strength and mobility through a variety of tools and tests. These tests may include: - functional reach - six-metre walk - timed up-and-go - sit-to-stand - spring balance Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 3|Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy Medication management Case managers, Registered Staff and Care workers should be aware of the medications each client is taking and how those medications effect whether they are a high or low risk patient (e.g. knowing antidepressants are associated with higher risk of falls). HHC will encourage all clients who experience a fall have their medications reviewed by a pharmacist. Responding to Falls All clients who have a fall, will undergo a post-fall assessment taken by Registered staff. All falls will be documented and recorded by Registered staff. Responding to falls checklist No. 1 3 4 6 Item Tick when complete Offer basic support and provide immediate reassurance 2 Take baseline measures including: - pulse - blood pressure - respiratory rate - oxygen saturation - blood sugar levels - if client hit head \\u2013 record neurological observations and inform medical officer for further investigation. Check for injuries Move the client - assess whether it is safe to move them - use a lifting device and comply with lifting procedures 5 Monitor the resident: - for potential internal bleeding (if alcoholic or on blood thinning medications) - ensure continued monitoring of the resident in case injuries appear later Report the fall to a medical officer immediately. 7 Record the fall - include details on client\\u2019s medical record, location of fall, evidence of injury, response - type of fall - dependency of client on staff/aids - clothing, footwear and eyewear if relevant at time of fall - changes in medication - restraints used - observation at the time - contributing environmental factors - witnesses to the fall Discuss the fall and future risk management strategies 8 Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 4|Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy Client records HHC will ensure that all clients\\u2019 falls risk status and falls history is recorded in their client file/individualised management plan.

It is not meant to be exhaustive; so if you are ever unsure of things, we want you to let us know. We look forward to you starting with us and may you find the journey meaningful and fulfilling. \\u201cAnd now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.\\u201d 1 Corinthians 13:13 Our Vision, Mission and Values Hope Holistic Care wants to build a community for older people to share eternal hope. A community comprises of clients, families, staff, health professionals and community service providers. We work to find the right people to deliver the right service at the right time with the right attitude. Working with HHC We work on the basis of trust, respect, honesty, openness and the principles of the Charter of aged care right. Communication is important and we want to make sure everyone is comfortable to raise suggestions or concerns. We try hard to achieve a win-win situation for everyone; this requires patience and understanding. Where this isn\\u2019t possible, we rely on grace and mercy, having a focus on our client\\u2019s outcomes. Staff Handbook Orientation When you first join us, we will send you information about standard practices and setup communication systems, including information technology. We will introduce you to our team of staff via a social app. If you have any questions, you will be able to contact a member of our office team. Scheduling availability and requests We will ask you when you are available to work. We will generally assign clients that fit your availability. We ask that we work together to find the best possible outcome for the client. We know that things change, so we will ask that you update your availability with us on a regular basis. Please let us know of changes at least 2 weeks or more in advance. Assigning client services When a client service is assigned to you, our office team will give you some background on the client so that you know what to expect. You will find the client\\u2019s care plan in the app for more information. If you are replacing someone on a shift, we will also provide a handover to help the client experience a seamless service. To find out more about what how to be successful in delivering services to our clients, please refer to the Things to be mindful of section. After the service, we will contact you to discuss how you went. We will also contact the client so that we can resolve any issues quickly to ensure positive experiences in future visits. Ongoing communications and feedback We enjoy open communications about clients, how to support you and opportunities to improve; therefore, please let us know if you have anything to share! You contact your manager directly, ring 02 7228 1369 or email info@hopehc.org.au to talk to us. If you want to provide anonymous feedback, you can do so by sending us a letter to our office. Code of Conduct for aged care and Ethical Behaviour Older people depend on us in varying capacities to maintain their well-being and live a quality life. We have the power to help them. Therefore, we need to be mindful to use our abilities to support older people and protect them from harm. We would do well to: 1. Act with respect for individual rights to freedom of expression, self-determination, and decision- making in accordance with relevant laws and conventions 2. Act in a way that treats people with dignity and respect, and values their diversity 3. Respect the privacy of everyone 4. Provide services in a safe and competent manner with care and skill 5. Act with integrity, honesty, and transparency 6. Promptly take steps to raise and act on concerns about matters that might have an impact on the quality and safety of services provided to people who are vulnerable 7. Provide care, supports and services free from: (i) all forms of violence, discrimination, exploitation, neglect and abuse (ii) sexual misconduct 8. Take all reasonable steps to prevent and respond to all forms of violence, exploitation, neglect, and abuse of people in our care Staff Handbook 1|Page Staff Handbook You can find out more about these behaviours in our Code of Ethical Conduct Policy \\u201cDear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.\\u201d Things to be mindful of Confidentiality 1 John 4:11 Often, we will learn things about clients other people will not know, either through conversations or reading documents. We need to remember to protect their confidentiality, and only share information to those who are also involved with their care. Before sharing any information, think about why you are sharing it. If it is necessary, be mindful to share only what needs to be known for that purpose. Also, think about whether you would like others talking about you in the same way. This applies to our colleagues and company information as well. Remember that we entrust each other with our information so that we can help meet each other\\u2019s needs. \\u201cDo not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen.\\u201d Ephesians 4:29 If you want to know more about this subject, you can access our Privacy Policy or talk to your manager about it. Safety, Security and Abuse When clients open their home to us, they are giving us a lot of power. We need to be mindful of this and use it responsibly. In everything we do or say, it\\u2019s important that we do so safely, as well as making them feel safe and secure. Abuse can occur when we come across as threatening, disrespectful; when we ignore their needs; when we touch them inappropriately; when we use physical force, or take advantage of their belongings, such as money. It is best that we treat our clients and colleagues with respect and humility. We need to show our concern for them by asking them if they feel safe and take actions if they say otherwise. \\u201cDo not devise harm against your neighbour, while he lives securely beside you.\\u201d Proverbs 3:29 If you want to find out more, you can refer to our Abuse and Neglect Policy or talk to your manager about it. Appearance Appearance can affect the comfort of clients we serve as well as what they think of the organisation. Therefore, we should always dress appropriately, being presentable, professional, clean, neat and tidy. All Care staff will be supplied with at least one HHC uniform shirt by the Office. Please use it and wash regularly. Appearance Guidelines Please follow the below guidelines: \\u2022 Identification badges should be worn to let clients know your name Staff Handbook 2|Page Staff Handbook \\u2022 In general, shoes should be sturdy, low heeled, protect the foot and have slip-resistant soles. We will wear shoe covers when we enter client\\u2019s homes. \\u2022 Uniforms are expected to be clean, tidy and not appear scrunched up. Hair When providing direct care, please tie your hair back if it is longer than shoulder length for hygiene purposes. Personal Items We should only be bringing what we need into the house. Consider bringing a small bag and keep it near the entrance of the home. This is to prevent suspicions of theft by the client. Try not to bring many personal items into the residence. Jewellery/Nails For safety purposes, when providing care, we should not wear rings (other than wedding bands), bracelets (other than medical alert bracelets), very long fingernails, nail polish, drop earrings and necklaces. Ear studs may be worn. This is to preserve the skin integrity of our clients and prevent unnecessary injury. Mobile phones We should generally refrain from using our mobile phones for personal reasons when working with a client. It is best to be kept in your bag so that you can pay attention to the client. If you are expecting an important call, notify the client in advance and minimise the time spent on the call. Smoking For the health and safety of our clients and colleagues, all working environments, including the client\\u2019s house and surrounds, are smoke-free. We encourage all staff to refrain from smoking whilst on shift and/or whilst travelling between clients. Hygiene and Infection Control Our clients can get very sick if they are infected with viruses or bacteria into their home. For the safety of them and us, we should keep ourselves clean and use personal protective equipment at appropriate times. This includes regular hand sanitisation, mask and glove wearing. You should always have these supplies with you. If you need to replenish them, please contact the office and we will arrange to deliver these to you. Please read the Infection Prevention and Control Policy and talk to your manager if you have any questions. Work Health and Safety Your health and safety are important to HHC. HHC is committed to the following: \\u2022 Regularly talk to you and ask you about work health and safety \\u2022 Develop safe procedures for everyone to use every day, including for emergencies \\u2022 Provide reporting systems and injury management What we need you to do is to: \\u2022 Use of the Home Safety Checklist at the client\\u2019s home before services start \\u2022 Take care for the safety of yourself and others Staff Handbook 3|Page Staff Handbook \\u2022 Comply with health and safety directions \\u2022 Report incidents and injury immediately \\u2022 Report and control hazards as you identify them, and report to management as needed Learning and Development We learn by experience and seeking answers to questions that come up in what we do each day. Therefore, HHC will actively encourage individual staff to reflect on the clients and services to identify opportunities for learning. We also organise group education sessions on topics that have been raised through client needs, staff requests and as required by industry standards or legislation. Employee relations Probation For Permanent or full-time staff, we generally provide a probationary period of 3 months, unless there is written notice from us to indicate otherwise. Payroll Enquiries Hope Holistic Care operates on a fortnightly pay cycle. Please contact the Office for any payroll enquiries Salary Packaging Hope Holistic Care is classified as a \\u201cpublic benevolent institution\\u201d (PBI). Therefore, it is able to offer full-time and part-time employees salary packaging \\u2013 reimbursing employees\\u2019 bills (tax free) up to $15,900 per annum. For more information, please contact the Office. Travel When visiting clients, the first trip to the client from your home and the last trip returning home will not be included in the mileage reimbursement. We will calculate the mileage for travel between the clients based on Google Maps and automatically pay you as travel allowance. If you assist the client with transportation or shopping during the visit, you will be able to report it in the app to claim reimbursement. Unless specified, there will not be any reimbursement for tolls paid during the travel to clients\\u2019 homes. Parking fines or any traffic infringements are not payable by HHC. Discrimination and Harassment Hope Holistic Care strives to maintain a working environment free from all forms of harassment or intimidation. Threatening, insulting or abusive words or behaviour towards another, or by displaying threatening, insulting or abusive words or pictures, unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favours and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature are serious violations of our policy and will not be condoned or permitted. HHC will not tolerate behaviour which is offensive, intimidating, humiliating, malicious, insulting or embarrassing and which is aimed at making an individual or group of individuals feel miserable, humiliated or lacking in self-confidence. It is expected that people in our workplace will behave in accordance with our Code of Ethical Behaviour. All reports of harassment, victimisation and bullying will be taken seriously, managed promptly and be treated with sensitivity and confidentiality. Staff Handbook 4|Page Staff Handbook Responsibilities Everyone is responsible to create and maintain a workplace environment that is free from any form of harassment. Managers and Supervisors Managers and supervisors must ensure that acceptable standards of behaviour are maintained in the workplace and have communicated the message that harassment will not be tolerated within the workplace. To meet these requirements, managers should: \\u2022 Ensure the work environment is free from discriminatory practices and unwelcome or offensive behaviour \\u2022 Treat harassment seriously, actively intervene and take early corrective action to deal with any behaviour or actions that may be considered inappropriate \\u2022 Handle any complaints in a fair, confidential and expeditious manner \\u2022 Ensure reprisal toward affected individuals does not occur \\u2022 Model appropriate behaviour \\u2022 Seek assistance from HR where there is any issue pertaining to harassment Staff Members and Volunteers All staff and volunteers are required to maintain acceptable standards of conduct and ensure that work is carried out in an environment free from all forms of harassment. All employees should: \\u2022 Reject immediately, any behaviour that is unwelcome and offensive \\u2022 Report any incident of harassment or bullying \\u2022 Not harass or bully, or participate in any behaviour that harasses or bullies other people Staff who become aware of harassment of others should: \\u2022 Advise their manager in the first instance \\u2022 Provide advice and assistance in making an informal or formal complaint \\u2022 Maintain confidentiality when providing information in an investigation Dispute and Grievance Settlement It is the responsibility of the organisation to provide you with the time, forums and mechanisms so you can tell us what you want us to hear. We encourage all employees to take responsibility for raising issues in a constructive way that will allow the organisation to acknowledge and take appropriate action. Any employee who believes that they have been unfairly treated, has the right to discuss the issue with their manager. Every manager within the organisation who has a grievance brought to their attention has the following obligations: \\u2022 To take the matter seriously \\u2022 To record the conversation and any agreed outcome \\u2022 To refer the matter to an appropriate person who can help the manager and employee resolve the issue In extreme circumstances, Hope Holistic Care may seek the assistance of an external qualified grievance management body to assist in resolving the matter. Staff Handbook 5|Page Staff Handbook A grievance should be lodged in writing and must identify the nature of the grievance, all of the persons involved, and the time and location in which the incident is reported to have arisen. Anonymous grievances will not be pursued by Hope Holistic Care. Senior management will treat all issues fairly, confidentially and without repercussions. False allegations are considered by Hope Holistic Care to be deliberate and wilful misconduct. Performance Management and Disciplinary Action The purpose of the performance management and disciplinary processes are to outline the steps that are required to be taken in order to resolve a performance management issue or a breach of terms and conditions of employment or organisation policy. This procedure is used to: \\u2022 Ensure fair treatment of staff at all times \\u2022 Establish a consistent approach to handling disciplinary matters \\u2022 Ensure that staff effort is channelled in the right direction \\u2022 Bring about a suitable change in any undesirable conduct/performance \\u2022 Prevent a situation of consistently unsatisfactory conduct/performance arising The purpose of counselling is to advise the staff member of any performance/conduct of concern and to establish if the organisation can provide assistance to avoid further instances of unacceptable performance/ conduct, whether through training, coaching or some other action. Summary Dismissal If you exhibit behaviour or engage in action that is either unlawful, negligent, or grossly offensive, you may be summarily dismissed. Examples include, but are not limited to: abuse, drug/alcohol abuse, misappropriation of funds, falsification of records, wilful refusal to obey reasonable directions and organisational policies/procedures.

It is particularly common for older Australians living in aged care facilities to experience falls. Hope Holistic Care (HHC) is committed to taking necessary measures to prevent falls and fall-related harm from occurring in our facilities. We will ensure appropriate falls assessment, prevention and management strategies are effectively implemented. We will also ensure that workers are adequately trained on how to assess, identify and mitigate falls. Definitions Syncope (fainting): is a temporary loss of consciousness, often related to insufficient blood flow to the brain. Most commonly occurring when blood pressure is too low, and the heart doesn\\u2019t pump enough oxygen to the brain. Polypharmacy: is the concurrent use of multiple medications by a patient. Vestibular dysfunction: is a common cause of dizziness among the older population. Continence: is the ability of a person to control bowel and bladder movements. Procedures Risk Screening and Assessment HHC will conduct a screening and assessment of all clients in our facilities upon arrival and every six months. This falls risk screening process will be undertaken by a Registered Nurse and will include the following assessment from the best practice guidelines, to determine if the resident is a high or low falls risk. After determining the risk category of each client, an individualised management plan will be developed by Registered staff which outlines the main falls risks and mitigations strategies. The management plan will be used so that all staff are aware of the risks posed to each individual client, and any additional environmental or medical strategies which may need to be implemented. Syncope (fainting) All clients will be assessed for syncope on arrival at the facility. Presyncope, syncope and postural hypotension will be included when developing the client\\u2019s management plan for falls prevention. The root causes of clients who report having unexplained falls or episodes will be identified and addressed. Dizziness and vertigo Clients will be assessed for vestibular dysfunction if they experience dizziness, vertigo or imbalance. Vestibular rehabilitation will be implemented to treat dizziness and balance problems where indicated. Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 1|Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy Vision Clients will receive an eye examination on arrival to determine if they have cataracts. Clients who have severe visual impairments will receive visual aids if necessary, and their environment will be modified accordingly. Client participation HHC will ensure that clients are involved during the falls prevention processes. We will: \\u2022 provide information which frames falls prevention as a means for clients to remain independent for longer; \\u2022 provide information on \\u2018falls prevention\\u2019 to clients in a manner they understand; \\u2022 seek client input in discussions about preventing falls; \\u2022 develop falls prevention programs which accommodate the individual client\\u2019s needs; and \\u2022 identify potential barriers the client may face when taking part in actions to prevent falls. Staff training HHC\\u2019s Registered staff will be trained on how to undertake screening and assessment of new clients to determine if they are a high or low falls risk. The Registered staff will be trained on how to identify potential barriers or hazards which could result in falls and injury. The care staff responsible for assisting clients who wear hip-protectors will undertake relevant training on the correct application of hip protectors. Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 2|Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy Management Strategies Feet and footwear Clients\\u2019 footwear will be reviewed regularly to ensure it meets the safety guidelines. Clients will be encouraged to wear soft soled shoes as opposed to slippers. Clients will also be encouraged to wear footwear when walking, to avoid the increased risk of falling barefoot. The facility will, where possible, provide grip socks to all clients who present a high falls risk, to wear during the night. Clients will be offerreded to be referred to a podiatrist on arrival if they present with foot issues which require specialised attention, who may assist in falls prevention. Environmental considerations HHC will monitor the client\\u2019s environment and be attentive to feedback concerning near misses and recommend mitigation strategies where fall risks are identified, including to report to My Aged Care for reassessment to get assistance with Home modifications. Minimising injuries from falls Hip protectors will be given to clients who require them. HHC will consider the clients\\u2019 falls history, mobility, steadiness, gait, disability status, osteoporosis and body index when deciding whether to use hip-protectors. HHC will also ensure that clients who require assistance to use hip-protectors receive the necessary support. Restraints HHC will not apply restraints at anytime or under any circumstances. If a staff member is at risk of harm, they are advised to exit the client\\u2019s home to a safe place before reporting to the Case manager of office personnel. Observation HHC will work with the client and/or their representative to ensure that higher falls risk clients are closely observed, such as via regular phone calls. Clients with dementia and other clients who have a high risk of falling, will be encouraged to apply devices which can detect their falls and send responses to designated contacts. Continence Clients will also be offered continence assessments to check if they have problems that can be modified or prevented. Improving balance with mobility and exercise HHC will develop tailored physical activity and exercise programs for clients to help strengthen and improve stability, strength and mobility. HHC will assess balance, strength and mobility through a variety of tools and tests. These tests may include: - functional reach - six-metre walk - timed up-and-go - sit-to-stand - spring balance Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 3|Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy Medication management Case managers, Registered Staff and Care workers should be aware of the medications each client is taking and how those medications effect whether they are a high or low risk patient (e.g. knowing antidepressants are associated with higher risk of falls). HHC will encourage all clients who experience a fall have their medications reviewed by a pharmacist. Responding to Falls All clients who have a fall, will undergo a post-fall assessment taken by Registered staff. All falls will be documented and recorded by Registered staff. Responding to falls checklist No. 1 3 4 6 Item Tick when complete Offer basic support and provide immediate reassurance 2 Take baseline measures including: - pulse - blood pressure - respiratory rate - oxygen saturation - blood sugar levels - if client hit head \\u2013 record neurological observations and inform medical officer for further investigation. Check for injuries Move the client - assess whether it is safe to move them - use a lifting device and comply with lifting procedures 5 Monitor the resident: - for potential internal bleeding (if alcoholic or on blood thinning medications) - ensure continued monitoring of the resident in case injuries appear later Report the fall to a medical officer immediately. 7 Record the fall - include details on client\\u2019s medical record, location of fall, evidence of injury, response - type of fall - dependency of client on staff/aids - clothing, footwear and eyewear if relevant at time of fall - changes in medication - restraints used - observation at the time - contributing environmental factors - witnesses to the fall Discuss the fall and future risk management strategies 8 Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 4|Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy Client records HHC will ensure that all clients\\u2019 falls risk status and falls history is recorded in their client file/individualised management plan. Client files will be updated every six months, following reassessment of a client\\u2019s falls risk status, and any time a falls-related incident occurs.

Hope Holistic Care will promote and adhere to the human rights of all clients and empower them to exercise their rights. Hope Holistic Care is committed to creating a culture where client safety is essential to service delivery, and clients and workers feel empowered to speak up and report abuse. Hope Holistic Care will outline the processes to: \\u2022 Assess the risks of abuse \\u2022 Prevent abuse from occurring \\u2022 Respond to abuse Definitions Exploitation: is taking advantage of someone\\u2019s vulnerabilities for your personal gain, to steal, use or profit. Exploitation often occurs with vulnerable groups such as people with a disability and older people. Exploitation is a form of abuse. Abuse: is any form of violence, coercion, exploitation, discrimination, harm or neglect which causes another person psychological or physical pain or suffering. Abuse can be emotional, physical, financial, chemical or sexual. Procedures Assessing risks of abuse: Workers will be trained to identify and respond to factors which may heighten the risk of clients being a victim of abuse. Workers will consider, for each client, the factors that can contribute to client vulnerability, such as social and geographical isolation, insecure accommodation, dependency on carers, not having the means or capacity to advocate for themselves, fragility and dysfunctional family lives. Preventing abuse Organisational commitment to prevention Hope Holistic Care has preventative measures in place to ensure that individuals are free from discrimination, exploitation, abuse, harm, neglect and violence. This includes policy and practice that protect people\\u2019s rights, and a commitment to empowering individuals by informing them about the rights that they possess. The organisation will foster a culture where all workers are committed to preventing abuse. All workers will undertake training in abuse prevention and client rights. Hope Holistic Care will ensure the staff recruitment screening process is thorough.

It is particularly common for older Australians living in aged care facilities to experience falls. Hope Holistic Care (HHC) is committed to taking necessary measures to prevent falls and fall-related harm from occurring in our facilities. We will ensure appropriate falls assessment, prevention and management strategies are effectively implemented. We will also ensure that workers are adequately trained on how to assess, identify and mitigate falls. Definitions Syncope (fainting): is a temporary loss of consciousness, often related to insufficient blood flow to the brain. Most commonly occurring when blood pressure is too low, and the heart doesn\\u2019t pump enough oxygen to the brain. Polypharmacy: is the concurrent use of multiple medications by a patient. Vestibular dysfunction: is a common cause of dizziness among the older population. Continence: is the ability of a person to control bowel and bladder movements. Procedures Risk Screening and Assessment HHC will conduct a screening and assessment of all clients in our facilities upon arrival and every six months. This falls risk screening process will be undertaken by a Registered Nurse and will include the following assessment from the best practice guidelines, to determine if the resident is a high or low falls risk. After determining the risk category of each client, an individualised management plan will be developed by Registered staff which outlines the main falls risks and mitigations strategies. The management plan will be used so that all staff are aware of the risks posed to each individual client, and any additional environmental or medical strategies which may need to be implemented. Syncope (fainting) All clients will be assessed for syncope on arrival at the facility. Presyncope, syncope and postural hypotension will be included when developing the client\\u2019s management plan for falls prevention. The root causes of clients who report having unexplained falls or episodes will be identified and addressed. Dizziness and vertigo Clients will be assessed for vestibular dysfunction if they experience dizziness, vertigo or imbalance. Vestibular rehabilitation will be implemented to treat dizziness and balance problems where indicated. Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 1|Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy Vision Clients will receive an eye examination on arrival to determine if they have cataracts. Clients who have severe visual impairments will receive visual aids if necessary, and their environment will be modified accordingly. Client participation HHC will ensure that clients are involved during the falls prevention processes. We will: \\u2022 provide information which frames falls prevention as a means for clients to remain independent for longer; \\u2022 provide information on \\u2018falls prevention\\u2019 to clients in a manner they understand; \\u2022 seek client input in discussions about preventing falls; \\u2022 develop falls prevention programs which accommodate the individual client\\u2019s needs; and \\u2022 identify potential barriers the client may face when taking part in actions to prevent falls. Staff training HHC\\u2019s Registered staff will be trained on how to undertake screening and assessment of new clients to determine if they are a high or low falls risk. The Registered staff will be trained on how to identify potential barriers or hazards which could result in falls and injury. The care staff responsible for assisting clients who wear hip-protectors will undertake relevant training on the correct application of hip protectors. Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 2|Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy Management Strategies Feet and footwear Clients\\u2019 footwear will be reviewed regularly to ensure it meets the safety guidelines. Clients will be encouraged to wear soft soled shoes as opposed to slippers. Clients will also be encouraged to wear footwear when walking, to avoid the increased risk of falling barefoot. The facility will, where possible, provide grip socks to all clients who present a high falls risk, to wear during the night. Clients will be offerreded to be referred to a podiatrist on arrival if they present with foot issues which require specialised attention, who may assist in falls prevention. Environmental considerations HHC will monitor the client\\u2019s environment and be attentive to feedback concerning near misses and recommend mitigation strategies where fall risks are identified, including to report to My Aged Care for reassessment to get assistance with Home modifications. Minimising injuries from falls Hip protectors will be given to clients who require them. HHC will consider the clients\\u2019 falls history, mobility, steadiness, gait, disability status, osteoporosis and body index when deciding whether to use hip-protectors. HHC will also ensure that clients who require assistance to use hip-protectors receive the necessary support. Restraints HHC will not apply restraints at anytime or under any circumstances. If a staff member is at risk of harm, they are advised to exit the client\\u2019s home to a safe place before reporting to the Case manager of office personnel. Observation HHC will work with the client and/or their representative to ensure that higher falls risk clients are closely observed, such as via regular phone calls. Clients with dementia and other clients who have a high risk of falling, will be encouraged to apply devices which can detect their falls and send responses to designated contacts. Continence Clients will also be offered continence assessments to check if they have problems that can be modified or prevented. Improving balance with mobility and exercise HHC will develop tailored physical activity and exercise programs for clients to help strengthen and improve stability, strength and mobility. HHC will assess balance, strength and mobility through a variety of tools and tests. These tests may include: - functional reach - six-metre walk - timed up-and-go - sit-to-stand - spring balance Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 3|Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy Medication management Case managers, Registered Staff and Care workers should be aware of the medications each client is taking and how those medications effect whether they are a high or low risk patient (e.g. knowing antidepressants are associated with higher risk of falls). HHC will encourage all clients who experience a fall have their medications reviewed by a pharmacist.

We ask that we work together to find the best possible outcome for the client. We know that things change, so we will ask that you update your availability with us on a regular basis. Please let us know of changes at least 2 weeks or more in advance. Assigning client services When a client service is assigned to you, our office team will give you some background on the client so that you know what to expect. You will find the client\\u2019s care plan in the app for more information. If you are replacing someone on a shift, we will also provide a handover to help the client experience a seamless service. To find out more about what how to be successful in delivering services to our clients, please refer to the Things to be mindful of section. After the service, we will contact you to discuss how you went. We will also contact the client so that we can resolve any issues quickly to ensure positive experiences in future visits. Ongoing communications and feedback We enjoy open communications about clients, how to support you and opportunities to improve; therefore, please let us know if you have anything to share! You contact your manager directly, ring 02 7228 1369 or email info@hopehc.org.au to talk to us. If you want to provide anonymous feedback, you can do so by sending us a letter to our office. Code of Conduct for aged care and Ethical Behaviour Older people depend on us in varying capacities to maintain their well-being and live a quality life. We have the power to help them. Therefore, we need to be mindful to use our abilities to support older people and protect them from harm. We would do well to: 1. Act with respect for individual rights to freedom of expression, self-determination, and decision- making in accordance with relevant laws and conventions 2. Act in a way that treats people with dignity and respect, and values their diversity 3. Respect the privacy of everyone 4. Provide services in a safe and competent manner with care and skill 5. Act with integrity, honesty, and transparency 6. Promptly take steps to raise and act on concerns about matters that might have an impact on the quality and safety of services provided to people who are vulnerable 7. Provide care, supports and services free from: (i) all forms of violence, discrimination, exploitation, neglect and abuse (ii) sexual misconduct 8. Take all reasonable steps to prevent and respond to all forms of violence, exploitation, neglect, and abuse of people in our care Staff Handbook 1|Page Staff Handbook You can find out more about these behaviours in our Code of Ethical Conduct Policy \\u201cDear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.\\u201d Things to be mindful of Confidentiality 1 John 4:11 Often, we will learn things about clients other people will not know, either through conversations or reading documents. We need to remember to protect their confidentiality, and only share information to those who are also involved with their care. Before sharing any information, think about why you are sharing it. If it is necessary, be mindful to share only what needs to be known for that purpose. Also, think about whether you would like others talking about you in the same way. This applies to our colleagues and company information as well. Remember that we entrust each other with our information so that we can help meet each other\\u2019s needs. \\u201cDo not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen.\\u201d Ephesians 4:29 If you want to know more about this subject, you can access our Privacy Policy or talk to your manager about it. Safety, Security and Abuse When clients open their home to us, they are giving us a lot of power. We need to be mindful of this and use it responsibly. In everything we do or say, it\\u2019s important that we do so safely, as well as making them feel safe and secure. Abuse can occur when we come across as threatening, disrespectful; when we ignore their needs; when we touch them inappropriately; when we use physical force, or take advantage of their belongings, such as money. It is best that we treat our clients and colleagues with respect and humility. We need to show our concern for them by asking them if they feel safe and take actions if they say otherwise. \\u201cDo not devise harm against your neighbour, while he lives securely beside you.\\u201d Proverbs 3:29 If you want to find out more, you can refer to our Abuse and Neglect Policy or talk to your manager about it. Appearance Appearance can affect the comfort of clients we serve as well as what they think of the organisation. Therefore, we should always dress appropriately, being presentable, professional, clean, neat and tidy. All Care staff will be supplied with at least one HHC uniform shirt by the Office. Please use it and wash regularly. Appearance Guidelines Please follow the below guidelines: \\u2022 Identification badges should be worn to let clients know your name Staff Handbook 2|Page Staff Handbook \\u2022 In general, shoes should be sturdy, low heeled, protect the foot and have slip-resistant soles. We will wear shoe covers when we enter client\\u2019s homes. \\u2022 Uniforms are expected to be clean, tidy and not appear scrunched up. Hair When providing direct care, please tie your hair back if it is longer than shoulder length for hygiene purposes. Personal Items We should only be bringing what we need into the house. Consider bringing a small bag and keep it near the entrance of the home. This is to prevent suspicions of theft by the client. Try not to bring many personal items into the residence. Jewellery/Nails For safety purposes, when providing care, we should not wear rings (other than wedding bands), bracelets (other than medical alert bracelets), very long fingernails, nail polish, drop earrings and necklaces. Ear studs may be worn. This is to preserve the skin integrity of our clients and prevent unnecessary injury. Mobile phones We should generally refrain from using our mobile phones for personal reasons when working with a client. It is best to be kept in your bag so that you can pay attention to the client. If you are expecting an important call, notify the client in advance and minimise the time spent on the call. Smoking For the health and safety of our clients and colleagues, all working environments, including the client\\u2019s house and surrounds, are smoke-free. We encourage all staff to refrain from smoking whilst on shift and/or whilst travelling between clients. Hygiene and Infection Control Our clients can get very sick if they are infected with viruses or bacteria into their home. For the safety of them and us, we should keep ourselves clean and use personal protective equipment at appropriate times. This includes regular hand sanitisation, mask and glove wearing. You should always have these supplies with you. If you need to replenish them, please contact the office and we will arrange to deliver these to you. Please read the Infection Prevention and Control Policy and talk to your manager if you have any questions. Work Health and Safety Your health and safety are important to HHC. HHC is committed to the following: \\u2022 Regularly talk to you and ask you about work health and safety \\u2022 Develop safe procedures for everyone to use every day, including for emergencies \\u2022 Provide reporting systems and injury management What we need you to do is to: \\u2022 Use of the Home Safety Checklist at the client\\u2019s home before services start \\u2022 Take care for the safety of yourself and others Staff Handbook 3|Page Staff Handbook \\u2022 Comply with health and safety directions \\u2022 Report incidents and injury immediately \\u2022 Report and control hazards as you identify them, and report to management as needed Learning and Development We learn by experience and seeking answers to questions that come up in what we do each day. Therefore, HHC will actively encourage individual staff to reflect on the clients and services to identify opportunities for learning. We also organise group education sessions on topics that have been raised through client needs, staff requests and as required by industry standards or legislation. Employee relations Probation For Permanent or full-time staff, we generally provide a probationary period of 3 months, unless there is written notice from us to indicate otherwise. Payroll Enquiries Hope Holistic Care operates on a fortnightly pay cycle. Please contact the Office for any payroll enquiries Salary Packaging Hope Holistic Care is classified as a \\u201cpublic benevolent institution\\u201d (PBI).

For more information, please contact the Office. Travel When visiting clients, the first trip to the client from your home and the last trip returning home will not be included in the mileage reimbursement.

Unless specified, there will not be any reimbursement for tolls paid during the travel to clients\\u2019 homes. Parking fines or any traffic infringements are not payable by HHC. Discrimination and Harassment Hope Holistic Care strives to maintain a working environment free from all forms of harassment or intimidation. Threatening, insulting or abusive words or behaviour towards another, or by displaying threatening, insulting or abusive words or pictures, unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favours and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature are serious violations of our policy and will not be condoned or permitted. HHC will not tolerate behaviour which is offensive, intimidating, humiliating, malicious, insulting or embarrassing and which is aimed at making an individual or group of individuals feel miserable, humiliated or lacking in self-confidence. It is expected that people in our workplace will behave in accordance with our Code of Ethical Behaviour. All reports of harassment, victimisation and bullying will be taken seriously, managed promptly and be treated with sensitivity and confidentiality. Staff Handbook 4|Page Staff Handbook Responsibilities Everyone is responsible to create and maintain a workplace environment that is free from any form of harassment. Managers and Supervisors Managers and supervisors must ensure that acceptable standards of behaviour are maintained in the workplace and have communicated the message that harassment will not be tolerated within the workplace.

Anonymous grievances will not be pursued by Hope Holistic Care. Senior management will treat all issues fairly, confidentially and without repercussions. False allegations are considered by Hope Holistic Care to be deliberate and wilful misconduct.

It is particularly common for older Australians living in aged care facilities to experience falls. Hope Holistic Care (HHC) is committed to taking necessary measures to prevent falls and fall-related harm from occurring in our facilities. We will ensure appropriate falls assessment, prevention and management strategies are effectively implemented. We will also ensure that workers are adequately trained on how to assess, identify and mitigate falls. Definitions Syncope (fainting): is a temporary loss of consciousness, often related to insufficient blood flow to the brain. Most commonly occurring when blood pressure is too low, and the heart doesn\\u2019t pump enough oxygen to the brain. Polypharmacy: is the concurrent use of multiple medications by a patient. Vestibular dysfunction: is a common cause of dizziness among the older population. Continence: is the ability of a person to control bowel and bladder movements. Procedures Risk Screening and Assessment HHC will conduct a screening and assessment of all clients in our facilities upon arrival and every six months.

It is particularly common for older Australians living in aged care facilities to experience falls. Hope Holistic Care (HHC) is committed to taking necessary measures to prevent falls and fall-related harm from occurring in our facilities. We will ensure appropriate falls assessment, prevention and management strategies are effectively implemented. We will also ensure that workers are adequately trained on how to assess, identify and mitigate falls. Definitions Syncope (fainting): is a temporary loss of consciousness, often related to insufficient blood flow to the brain. Most commonly occurring when blood pressure is too low, and the heart doesn\\u2019t pump enough oxygen to the brain. Polypharmacy: is the concurrent use of multiple medications by a patient. Vestibular dysfunction: is a common cause of dizziness among the older population. Continence: is the ability of a person to control bowel and bladder movements. Procedures Risk Screening and Assessment HHC will conduct a screening and assessment of all clients in our facilities upon arrival and every six months. This falls risk screening process will be undertaken by a Registered Nurse and will include the following assessment from the best practice guidelines, to determine if the resident is a high or low falls risk. After determining the risk category of each client, an individualised management plan will be developed by Registered staff which outlines the main falls risks and mitigations strategies. The management plan will be used so that all staff are aware of the risks posed to each individual client, and any additional environmental or medical strategies which may need to be implemented. Syncope (fainting) All clients will be assessed for syncope on arrival at the facility. Presyncope, syncope and postural hypotension will be included when developing the client\\u2019s management plan for falls prevention. The root causes of clients who report having unexplained falls or episodes will be identified and addressed. Dizziness and vertigo Clients will be assessed for vestibular dysfunction if they experience dizziness, vertigo or imbalance. Vestibular rehabilitation will be implemented to treat dizziness and balance problems where indicated. Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 1|Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy Vision Clients will receive an eye examination on arrival to determine if they have cataracts. Clients who have severe visual impairments will receive visual aids if necessary, and their environment will be modified accordingly. Client participation HHC will ensure that clients are involved during the falls prevention processes. We will: \\u2022 provide information which frames falls prevention as a means for clients to remain independent for longer; \\u2022 provide information on \\u2018falls prevention\\u2019 to clients in a manner they understand; \\u2022 seek client input in discussions about preventing falls; \\u2022 develop falls prevention programs which accommodate the individual client\\u2019s needs; and \\u2022 identify potential barriers the client may face when taking part in actions to prevent falls. Staff training HHC\\u2019s Registered staff will be trained on how to undertake screening and assessment of new clients to determine if they are a high or low falls risk. The Registered staff will be trained on how to identify potential barriers or hazards which could result in falls and injury. The care staff responsible for assisting clients who wear hip-protectors will undertake relevant training on the correct application of hip protectors. Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 2|Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy Management Strategies Feet and footwear Clients\\u2019 footwear will be reviewed regularly to ensure it meets the safety guidelines. Clients will be encouraged to wear soft soled shoes as opposed to slippers. Clients will also be encouraged to wear footwear when walking, to avoid the increased risk of falling barefoot. The facility will, where possible, provide grip socks to all clients who present a high falls risk, to wear during the night. Clients will be offerreded to be referred to a podiatrist on arrival if they present with foot issues which require specialised attention, who may assist in falls prevention. Environmental considerations HHC will monitor the client\\u2019s environment and be attentive to feedback concerning near misses and recommend mitigation strategies where fall risks are identified, including to report to My Aged Care for reassessment to get assistance with Home modifications. Minimising injuries from falls Hip protectors will be given to clients who require them. HHC will consider the clients\\u2019 falls history, mobility, steadiness, gait, disability status, osteoporosis and body index when deciding whether to use hip-protectors. HHC will also ensure that clients who require assistance to use hip-protectors receive the necessary support. Restraints HHC will not apply restraints at anytime or under any circumstances. If a staff member is at risk of harm, they are advised to exit the client\\u2019s home to a safe place before reporting to the Case manager of office personnel. Observation HHC will work with the client and/or their representative to ensure that higher falls risk clients are closely observed, such as via regular phone calls. Clients with dementia and other clients who have a high risk of falling, will be encouraged to apply devices which can detect their falls and send responses to designated contacts. Continence Clients will also be offered continence assessments to check if they have problems that can be modified or prevented. Improving balance with mobility and exercise HHC will develop tailored physical activity and exercise programs for clients to help strengthen and improve stability, strength and mobility. HHC will assess balance, strength and mobility through a variety of tools and tests. These tests may include: - functional reach - six-metre walk - timed up-and-go - sit-to-stand - spring balance Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 3|Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy Medication management Case managers, Registered Staff and Care workers should be aware of the medications each client is taking and how those medications effect whether they are a high or low risk patient (e.g. knowing antidepressants are associated with higher risk of falls). HHC will encourage all clients who experience a fall have their medications reviewed by a pharmacist. Responding to Falls All clients who have a fall, will undergo a post-fall assessment taken by Registered staff. All falls will be documented and recorded by Registered staff. Responding to falls checklist No. 1 3 4 6 Item Tick when complete Offer basic support and provide immediate reassurance 2 Take baseline measures including: - pulse - blood pressure - respiratory rate - oxygen saturation - blood sugar levels - if client hit head \\u2013 record neurological observations and inform medical officer for further investigation. Check for injuries Move the client - assess whether it is safe to move them - use a lifting device and comply with lifting procedures 5 Monitor the resident: - for potential internal bleeding (if alcoholic or on blood thinning medications) - ensure continued monitoring of the resident in case injuries appear later Report the fall to a medical officer immediately. 7 Record the fall - include details on client\\u2019s medical record, location of fall, evidence of injury, response - type of fall - dependency of client on staff/aids - clothing, footwear and eyewear if relevant at time of fall - changes in medication - restraints used - observation at the time - contributing environmental factors - witnesses to the fall Discuss the fall and future risk management strategies 8 Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 4|Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy Client records HHC will ensure that all clients\\u2019 falls risk status and falls history is recorded in their client file/individualised management plan. Client files will be updated every six months, following reassessment of a client\\u2019s falls risk status, and any time a falls-related incident occurs.

While the files provided do not contain specific guidance for carers assisting with medication, generally, here is an appropriate response: Understand Your Scope of Practice: Ensure that any assistance you provide with medication is within your legally defined scope of practice. Healthcare Professional Involvement: Medication management should ideally be done by or under the supervision of a healthcare professional who is authorized to handle medication, such as a Registered Nurse or a doctor. Seek Authorization: If you have not been given explicit authorization or training in medication management, get permission from a supervisor or manager before providing any help with medication. Follow the Care Plan: If you are authorized to help with medication, ensure you strictly follow the care plan that should outline medication management including dosages and times. Record and Report: Any assistance with medication should be recorded in the client's care notes, and any unusual events or issues should be reported to your supervisor according to the host organization's policy. In cases where you are unsure, the safest course of action is to refer the request to a trained health professional or ask the carer to contact the client's physician or pharmacy for further guidance. It is also advisable to review the organization\\u2019s policies and procedures related to medication management for detailed instructions on how to proceed in such situations. If you need to review specific policies related to this scenario, please refer to your organization's handbook or management for further instructions.\",\n",

Clients\\u2019 money may only be used for the purposes intended by the client. Client cash It is important for clients to have ready access to their own cash to purchase personal items and for day-to-day expenses which are for the direct benefit of the client. Clients will usually withdraw cash from their personal savings accounts for this purpose. There may be other arrangements by which clients gain access to personal spending money. Clients will be permitted choice to decide how much assistance they require with their cash. Some clients will choose to retain control with minimal assistance, while others will rely on staff. When making purchases for a client, staff members must keep all receipts as proof of purchase. Client Money Management Policy_POL_V01_2209 1|Page Client Money Management Procedure On completion of shopping, details of the purchase made and the change received are to be recorded in the Money Handling record in Knack.

It is particularly common for older Australians living in aged care facilities to experience falls. Hope Holistic Care (HHC) is committed to taking necessary measures to prevent falls and fall-related harm from occurring in our facilities. We will ensure appropriate falls assessment, prevention and management strategies are effectively implemented. We will also ensure that workers are adequately trained on how to assess, identify and mitigate falls. Definitions Syncope (fainting): is a temporary loss of consciousness, often related to insufficient blood flow to the brain. Most commonly occurring when blood pressure is too low, and the heart doesn\\u2019t pump enough oxygen to the brain. Polypharmacy: is the concurrent use of multiple medications by a patient. Vestibular dysfunction: is a common cause of dizziness among the older population. Continence: is the ability of a person to control bowel and bladder movements. Procedures Risk Screening and Assessment HHC will conduct a screening and assessment of all clients in our facilities upon arrival and every six months. This falls risk screening process will be undertaken by a Registered Nurse and will include the following assessment from the best practice guidelines, to determine if the resident is a high or low falls risk. After determining the risk category of each client, an individualised management plan will be developed by Registered staff which outlines the main falls risks and mitigations strategies. The management plan will be used so that all staff are aware of the risks posed to each individual client, and any additional environmental or medical strategies which may need to be implemented. Syncope (fainting) All clients will be assessed for syncope on arrival at the facility. Presyncope, syncope and postural hypotension will be included when developing the client\\u2019s management plan for falls prevention. The root causes of clients who report having unexplained falls or episodes will be identified and addressed. Dizziness and vertigo Clients will be assessed for vestibular dysfunction if they experience dizziness, vertigo or imbalance. Vestibular rehabilitation will be implemented to treat dizziness and balance problems where indicated. Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 1|Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy Vision Clients will receive an eye examination on arrival to determine if they have cataracts. Clients who have severe visual impairments will receive visual aids if necessary, and their environment will be modified accordingly. Client participation HHC will ensure that clients are involved during the falls prevention processes. We will: \\u2022 provide information which frames falls prevention as a means for clients to remain independent for longer; \\u2022 provide information on \\u2018falls prevention\\u2019 to clients in a manner they understand; \\u2022 seek client input in discussions about preventing falls; \\u2022 develop falls prevention programs which accommodate the individual client\\u2019s needs; and \\u2022 identify potential barriers the client may face when taking part in actions to prevent falls. Staff training HHC\\u2019s Registered staff will be trained on how to undertake screening and assessment of new clients to determine if they are a high or low falls risk. The Registered staff will be trained on how to identify potential barriers or hazards which could result in falls and injury. The care staff responsible for assisting clients who wear hip-protectors will undertake relevant training on the correct application of hip protectors. Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 2|Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy Management Strategies Feet and footwear Clients\\u2019 footwear will be reviewed regularly to ensure it meets the safety guidelines. Clients will be encouraged to wear soft soled shoes as opposed to slippers. Clients will also be encouraged to wear footwear when walking, to avoid the increased risk of falling barefoot. The facility will, where possible, provide grip socks to all clients who present a high falls risk, to wear during the night. Clients will be offerreded to be referred to a podiatrist on arrival if they present with foot issues which require specialised attention, who may assist in falls prevention. Environmental considerations HHC will monitor the client\\u2019s environment and be attentive to feedback concerning near misses and recommend mitigation strategies where fall risks are identified, including to report to My Aged Care for reassessment to get assistance with Home modifications. Minimising injuries from falls Hip protectors will be given to clients who require them. HHC will consider the clients\\u2019 falls history, mobility, steadiness, gait, disability status, osteoporosis and body index when deciding whether to use hip-protectors. HHC will also ensure that clients who require assistance to use hip-protectors receive the necessary support. Restraints HHC will not apply restraints at anytime or under any circumstances. If a staff member is at risk of harm, they are advised to exit the client\\u2019s home to a safe place before reporting to the Case manager of office personnel. Observation HHC will work with the client and/or their representative to ensure that higher falls risk clients are closely observed, such as via regular phone calls. Clients with dementia and other clients who have a high risk of falling, will be encouraged to apply devices which can detect their falls and send responses to designated contacts. Continence Clients will also be offered continence assessments to check if they have problems that can be modified or prevented. Improving balance with mobility and exercise HHC will develop tailored physical activity and exercise programs for clients to help strengthen and improve stability, strength and mobility. HHC will assess balance, strength and mobility through a variety of tools and tests. These tests may include: - functional reach - six-metre walk - timed up-and-go - sit-to-stand - spring balance Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 3|Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy Medication management Case managers, Registered Staff and Care workers should be aware of the medications each client is taking and how those medications effect whether they are a high or low risk patient (e.g. knowing antidepressants are associated with higher risk of falls). HHC will encourage all clients who experience a fall have their medications reviewed by a pharmacist. Responding to Falls All clients who have a fall, will undergo a post-fall assessment taken by Registered staff. All falls will be documented and recorded by Registered staff. Responding to falls checklist No. 1 3 4 6 Item Tick when complete Offer basic support and provide immediate reassurance 2 Take baseline measures including: - pulse - blood pressure - respiratory rate - oxygen saturation - blood sugar levels - if client hit head \\u2013 record neurological observations and inform medical officer for further investigation. Check for injuries Move the client - assess whether it is safe to move them - use a lifting device and comply with lifting procedures 5 Monitor the resident: - for potential internal bleeding (if alcoholic or on blood thinning medications) - ensure continued monitoring of the resident in case injuries appear later Report the fall to a medical officer immediately. 7 Record the fall - include details on client\\u2019s medical record, location of fall, evidence of injury, response - type of fall - dependency of client on staff/aids - clothing, footwear and eyewear if relevant at time of fall - changes in medication - restraints used - observation at the time - contributing environmental factors - witnesses to the fall Discuss the fall and future risk management strategies 8 Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 4|Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy Client records HHC will ensure that all clients\\u2019 falls risk status and falls history is recorded in their client file/individualised management plan.

Sometimes people behave inappropriately without realising, or make decisions without considering the repercussions. Telling the person will give them the chance to stop or change what they are doing. The following steps should be followed for this step: a) If you have a grievance at work, do not ignore the problem. b) Speak to the person who you believe to be the cause of the grievance, explaining how you feel as soon as practicable after the problem has arisen. If the grievance is about their behaviour, tell them that it is not acceptable, it is offensive, unsuitable or hurtful. If it is about a work decision, tell them why you think it is unfair, inappropriate etc. c) Keep a diary note of the date and content of the discussion and if there were any witnesses present d) If the behaviour persists or if no agreement can be achieved, you are able to lodge a formal complaint as outlined below Should adopting an informal approach to resolving a grievance prove unsuccessful, or the matter is highly sensitive and not appropriate for an informal process, the following steps give guidance for managing a formal grievance: a) Notification- (making a complaint) You must notify, in writing or otherwise, the substance of the grievance and attempt to resolve it with your immediate Manager. The CEO may become involved depending on the situation. If the grievance is of a nature that you cannot notify your immediate Manager because it is not appropriate, you may notify the next reporting level up. For particularly difficult or sensitive grievances, where referral up to the next level is neither the appropriate or preferred avenue, you may refer the matter, in writing to, direct to the CEO. b) Investigation and reporting The grievance is investigated. Relevant material and information are sought, including information from other sources where appropriate. Documentation is complied. the length and formality of communication about the grievance will depend on the seriousness and complexity of the complaint, but should generally at this stage be minimal. Communication to those involved, should include Grievance Management Procedure_PRO_V01_2201 3|Page Grievance Management Procedure suggested actions/options to resolve the grievance or to provide guidance for referring the matter to the next level up or to the CEO as appropriate. All investigation and disciplinary processes conducted at HHC will be managed in accordance with the relevant Award and/or legislation, and principles of natural justice. If an employee or volunteer is required to respond to allegations against them as part of the investigation process, or respond to concerns raised as part of a disciplinary process, the following requirements will apply: The employee or volunteer will be provided with an opportunity to respond to any allegations or concerns regarding their behaviour, including adequate notice to prepare their response which will be a minimum of 24 hours\\u2019 notice following written notification of an interview/disciplinary meeting. The employee or volunteer will be provided an opportunity to have an appropriate support person present at any interview/ disciplinary meeting. Please note that colleagues will not be considered an appropriate support person if they are a witness or otherwise involved in the investigation/disciplinary process. A written record will be made of formal investigation interviews and disciplinary meetings, and a copy will be made available to the employee as soon as practicable after the meeting. c) Action and record any outcome Solution available- A proposed solution is provided to you. If acceptable, it is implemented. If the solution affects other employees or volunteers, it must be notified to and agreed with them in advance. Solution not Immediately available- You and your Manager are to confer with a more Senior Manager. If the matter is still not resolved- If the matter is still not resolved, you may refer the matter for consideration of and resolution by the CEO. This may involve a meeting with you, your Manager (if appropriate) and the CEO, if in HHC opinion such a meeting would assist a resolution. If the matter is still not resolved- Either you or HHC can go to the Fair Work Commission or if agreed to another third party for conciliation. Work must continue- Work must continue in the manner required while the grievance is being dealt with. The fact that work continues does not prejudice you or HHC. 6 Confidentiality At all times during the grievance procedure, management and the CEO will maintain confidentiality as far as possible. Employees, contractors and volunteers involved in the grievance, are required to maintain confidentiality. This means that they cannot talk to other employees, volunteers or contractors about the grievance. A support person may be made available if required.

Hope Holistic Care fosters a rights-based, learning environment for older people to live the best life they can. HHC promotes dignity of risk as a way to maintain client independence, responsibility and ultimately, meaningful living. HHC exercises its Duty of Care to protect clients in areas they may be vulnerable to harm compared to an fully-abled human being. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf4Y7v-SLtc (Duty of Care, Dignity of Risk, Overprotection, Neglect) Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy Policy Client Decision Making and Choice Hope Holistic Care is committed to empowering clients to play an active role in decisions that affect their lives and to make choices for themselves: The organisation will: \\u2022 inform clients about the opportunities for choice available to them \\u2022 support clients to make informed choices which will provide them opportunities \\u2022 keep records of client preferences regarding their service \\u2022 enable clients to build self-reliance and maintain social inclusion Supported Decision-Making and Dignity of Risk Hope Holistic Care acknowledges that all clients have a human right to make decisions about their own life and to have those decisions respected. Hope Holistic Care understands and affirms that cognitive impairment is not a reason for a person to be excluded from the decision-making process about their own life. Hope Holistic Care understands that not all decisions require assistance and will support clients primarily when they make significant decisions which have immediate or long-term consequences regarding their health, finances or lifestyle. Hope Holistic Care is committed to supporting clients with complex care and communication needs to make their own decisions regarding their life. The will and preferences of a client will only be overridden if a decision is deemed by staff or advocates to be dangerous to the wellbeing of the client or others. Definitions Decision is a planned course of action, either short or long term, regarding the lifestyle, healthcare or financial affairs of an individual. Dignity of risk is the recognition that every individual should be able to do something that has a level of risk involved, whether real or perceived. Financial Decisions include but are not limited to: \\u2022 Investment decisions; \\u2022 Sale or gifts of property or valuable possessions; \\u2022 Use of money. Functional Capacity Assessment is an assessment of an individual\\u2019s decision-making capacity in the present moment. The assessment should focus on the person\\u2019s understanding of the decision, its context and consequences, and should not contain a judgement on whether a person\\u2019s decision is wise or unwise. Healthcare Decisions include but are not limited to: \\u2022 Seeking or obtaining a diagnosis; Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy _POL_V01_2209 1|Page Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy \\u2022 Accessing (or refusing) care services; \\u2022 Responding to crisis (falls, incidents); \\u2022 Agreeing or refusing medical treatment; \\u2022 Advance care planning. Lifestyle Decisions include but are not limited to: \\u2022 Living arrangements; \\u2022 Relationships; \\u2022 Employment; \\u2022 Civic participation; \\u2022 Holidays and outings; \\u2022 Pets and possessions. Representative is a person or organisation that assists the client in the decision-making process and, where necessary, makes decisions on behalf of the client. A Representative is designated by a client, or by appointment from another body if the client is unfit to nominate a Representative, and includes a Substitute Decision Maker. Substitute Decision Maker (guardian) is a legally appointed person such as a guardian to make decisions on behalf of a client in certain areas, for example Healthcare Decisions and Lifestyle Decisions, or a financial manager to make Financial Decisions. A Substitute Decision Maker should work with a client\\u2019s informal support networks to support a client to build their decision-making capacity. Substituted Judgement is a decision made by a Representative regarding a client who is unable to communicate their will and preferences, or when a client\\u2019s will and preferences infringe on their rights or the rights of others. A Substituted Judgement is based on the client\\u2019s previous expressed will and preferences or, if this is unknown, a Representative\\u2019s interpretation of \\u2018what the client would have wanted\\u2019. Supporter is a person or organisation who is designated by the client or organisation to aid in the communication and development of the client\\u2019s wishes regarding their care. Supporters may be required to aid in the decision-making process, however the ultimate decision-making power lies with the client. Procedures Choice Information strategies Information in appropriate formats about the opportunities for client choice will be provided to clients at each major service point from intake to end of service. If clients have literacy or communication issues, then every effort should be made to ensure they understand their rights and opportunities in making decisions regarding services. The information is available in the following documents: \\u2022 Consultation about HHC services \\u2022 Care planning process Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy _POL_V01_2209 2|Page Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy \\u2022 Review of Care Plan \\u2022 Annual Survey \\u2022 Advance care planning \\u2022 Complaints Support to make choices Clients will have the opportunity to make choices about their service in the following ways: \\u2022 service delivery access - types of service available, the days and times a service can be accessed, frequency of attendance, the location, how the service is provided to ensure that it meets individual needs (particularly in terms of physical, cultural or communication needs) \\u2022 individual service planning - expressing preferences for the level or intensity of service, which other services are involved, the ways that personal goals will be achieved, how progress reviews are conducted, and decisions about changes or exiting the service Hope Holistic Care actively supports service users to make choices in the way they use services: \\u2022 follow-up on written information and specific assistance to clients who may experience cultural or language barriers, or who may need specialised advocacy or support to take full advantage of the opportunities, providing information in a range of mediums: written, pictorial, verbal. Record keeping Hope Holistic Care documents all input from clients regarding their service preferences. This is recorded on the client\\u2019s file. Supported Decision making and Dignity of Risk Clients will be provided with access to the support necessary for them to make, communicate and participate in decisions regarding their life and care. Clients should be provided with a Chinese format of this policy and be supported to understand it. Staff will receive information and training on the nature of capacity in decision-making and how to support client decision-making that upholds clients\\u2019 rights. Designating the role of Supporters and Representatives Supporters and Representatives should be designated by or with the consent of the client, and their roles can be formalised into a written decision-making agreement. To avoid conflicts of interest, Supporters and Representatives should preferably not be in a position where they have interests in Hope Holistic Care or any other service provider delivering services to the client, as this may compromise their role. Where this is unavoidable, the written supported decision-making agreement should include a declaration of any conflicts of interest if they exist, and specify how actual or potential conflicts will be managed. Supported decision-making should occur in collaboration with informal support networks such as friends, family, peer support and independent advocates. This will help to create a natural safeguard for the client and prevent Supporters from making decisions which are not in the client\\u2019s best interests. Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy _POL_V01_2209 3|Page Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy Assessing client decision-making capacity Care workers will notify the Case Manager if there are concerns regarding a client\\u2019s decision-making capacity. The Case Manager will assess the situation and discuss with the client and their carer/representative regarding decision making support processes. Suggestions may be made to refer the client to relevant and qualified assessors (e.g. Solicitor, GP, social worker etc) for an assessment to be made to determine the client\\u2019s decision-making capacity. Substituted Judgement If it is determined that the client is unfit to make a decision regarding their life, their will and preferences will be overridden, and a Substituted Judgement will be made by the authorised Representative. This is considered as a last resort. Clients will only receive a Substituted Judgement or have their will and preferences overridden if: \\u2022 They cannot understand any of the risks associated with their decisions; or \\u2022 The proposed decision presents a threat to the wellbeing of the client or others. Supporting decision-making The current or previously expressed will and preferences of the client will be respected and carried out unless they are unlawful, or compromise other rights such as their right to safety, or the rights of others. In the process of supporting a client\\u2019s decision: 1. A client\\u2019s will and preference should be respected and given effect; If will and preference are not known: 2. The Representative(s) must make a decision on what the client would likely want, based on the information available; If it is not possible to determine what the client would likely want: 3. The Representative must act to preserve the client\\u2019s human rights and make the least restrictive decisions regarding those rights. Where clients require assistance in the communication of their will and preference, the organisation will provide the appropriate tools and strategies for the client to express themselves. This may include use of pictures, assistive technology or language services. Staff will support and assist clients to understand the context and consequences of their decisions. Staff will work proactively with clients to establish social histories, life-story work and care plans as documentation which might assist in future decision-making scenarios. Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy _POL_V01_2209 4|Page Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy Dignity of risk Supporters will respect an individual\\u2019s right to the dignity of risk and will not dissuade them from making a decision based on the associated risks alone, whether real or perceived. If a client\\u2019s decision involves some level of risk, Supporters should ensure that the client can foresee and understand the risks associated with the decision. Staff will attempt to manage the risks associated with significant decisions, while not attempting to change the client\\u2019s mind regarding a decision. Process for dealing with perceived conflict of interest If a staff member or person from a client\\u2019s support network believes a Representative or Supporter is not acting in the best interests of a client, they are to notify the Home Care Manager as soon as possible. Following a complaint in relation to an assisted decision, the Home Care Manager will assess whether the Representative or Supporter\\u2019s vested interest in the decision influenced their actions. If it is found that the Supporter or Representative had a vested interest in a decision and the decision made was not in the best interests of the client, they will be removed as a Supporter or Representative. If required, matters involving the abuse of Representative decision-making may be referred to the Guardianship tribunal or the Police or a relevant external body, depending on the situation. Documentation For Substituted Judgements that may have significant immediate and long-term consequences, the decision-making process and outcome will be documented and will be stored in the client\\u2019s case file.

It is particularly common for older Australians living in aged care facilities to experience falls. Hope Holistic Care (HHC) is committed to taking necessary measures to prevent falls and fall-related harm from occurring in our facilities. We will ensure appropriate falls assessment, prevention and management strategies are effectively implemented. We will also ensure that workers are adequately trained on how to assess, identify and mitigate falls. Definitions Syncope (fainting): is a temporary loss of consciousness, often related to insufficient blood flow to the brain. Most commonly occurring when blood pressure is too low, and the heart doesn\\u2019t pump enough oxygen to the brain. Polypharmacy: is the concurrent use of multiple medications by a patient. Vestibular dysfunction: is a common cause of dizziness among the older population. Continence: is the ability of a person to control bowel and bladder movements. Procedures Risk Screening and Assessment HHC will conduct a screening and assessment of all clients in our facilities upon arrival and every six months. This falls risk screening process will be undertaken by a Registered Nurse and will include the following assessment from the best practice guidelines, to determine if the resident is a high or low falls risk. After determining the risk category of each client, an individualised management plan will be developed by Registered staff which outlines the main falls risks and mitigations strategies. The management plan will be used so that all staff are aware of the risks posed to each individual client, and any additional environmental or medical strategies which may need to be implemented. Syncope (fainting) All clients will be assessed for syncope on arrival at the facility. Presyncope, syncope and postural hypotension will be included when developing the client\\u2019s management plan for falls prevention. The root causes of clients who report having unexplained falls or episodes will be identified and addressed. Dizziness and vertigo Clients will be assessed for vestibular dysfunction if they experience dizziness, vertigo or imbalance. Vestibular rehabilitation will be implemented to treat dizziness and balance problems where indicated. Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 1|Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy Vision Clients will receive an eye examination on arrival to determine if they have cataracts. Clients who have severe visual impairments will receive visual aids if necessary, and their environment will be modified accordingly. Client participation HHC will ensure that clients are involved during the falls prevention processes. We will: \\u2022 provide information which frames falls prevention as a means for clients to remain independent for longer; \\u2022 provide information on \\u2018falls prevention\\u2019 to clients in a manner they understand; \\u2022 seek client input in discussions about preventing falls; \\u2022 develop falls prevention programs which accommodate the individual client\\u2019s needs; and \\u2022 identify potential barriers the client may face when taking part in actions to prevent falls. Staff training HHC\\u2019s Registered staff will be trained on how to undertake screening and assessment of new clients to determine if they are a high or low falls risk. The Registered staff will be trained on how to identify potential barriers or hazards which could result in falls and injury. The care staff responsible for assisting clients who wear hip-protectors will undertake relevant training on the correct application of hip protectors. Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 2|Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy Management Strategies Feet and footwear Clients\\u2019 footwear will be reviewed regularly to ensure it meets the safety guidelines. Clients will be encouraged to wear soft soled shoes as opposed to slippers. Clients will also be encouraged to wear footwear when walking, to avoid the increased risk of falling barefoot. The facility will, where possible, provide grip socks to all clients who present a high falls risk, to wear during the night. Clients will be offerreded to be referred to a podiatrist on arrival if they present with foot issues which require specialised attention, who may assist in falls prevention. Environmental considerations HHC will monitor the client\\u2019s environment and be attentive to feedback concerning near misses and recommend mitigation strategies where fall risks are identified, including to report to My Aged Care for reassessment to get assistance with Home modifications. Minimising injuries from falls Hip protectors will be given to clients who require them. HHC will consider the clients\\u2019 falls history, mobility, steadiness, gait, disability status, osteoporosis and body index when deciding whether to use hip-protectors. HHC will also ensure that clients who require assistance to use hip-protectors receive the necessary support. Restraints HHC will not apply restraints at anytime or under any circumstances. If a staff member is at risk of harm, they are advised to exit the client\\u2019s home to a safe place before reporting to the Case manager of office personnel. Observation HHC will work with the client and/or their representative to ensure that higher falls risk clients are closely observed, such as via regular phone calls. Clients with dementia and other clients who have a high risk of falling, will be encouraged to apply devices which can detect their falls and send responses to designated contacts. Continence Clients will also be offered continence assessments to check if they have problems that can be modified or prevented. Improving balance with mobility and exercise HHC will develop tailored physical activity and exercise programs for clients to help strengthen and improve stability, strength and mobility. HHC will assess balance, strength and mobility through a variety of tools and tests. These tests may include: - functional reach - six-metre walk - timed up-and-go - sit-to-stand - spring balance Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 3|Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy Medication management Case managers, Registered Staff and Care workers should be aware of the medications each client is taking and how those medications effect whether they are a high or low risk patient (e.g. knowing antidepressants are associated with higher risk of falls). HHC will encourage all clients who experience a fall have their medications reviewed by a pharmacist. Responding to Falls All clients who have a fall, will undergo a post-fall assessment taken by Registered staff. All falls will be documented and recorded by Registered staff. Responding to falls checklist No. 1 3 4 6 Item Tick when complete Offer basic support and provide immediate reassurance 2 Take baseline measures including: - pulse - blood pressure - respiratory rate - oxygen saturation - blood sugar levels - if client hit head \\u2013 record neurological observations and inform medical officer for further investigation. Check for injuries Move the client - assess whether it is safe to move them - use a lifting device and comply with lifting procedures 5 Monitor the resident: - for potential internal bleeding (if alcoholic or on blood thinning medications) - ensure continued monitoring of the resident in case injuries appear later Report the fall to a medical officer immediately. 7 Record the fall - include details on client\\u2019s medical record, location of fall, evidence of injury, response - type of fall - dependency of client on staff/aids - clothing, footwear and eyewear if relevant at time of fall - changes in medication - restraints used - observation at the time - contributing environmental factors - witnesses to the fall Discuss the fall and future risk management strategies 8 Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 4|Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy Client records HHC will ensure that all clients\\u2019 falls risk status and falls history is recorded in their client file/individualised management plan. Client files will be updated every six months, following reassessment of a client\\u2019s falls risk status, and any time a falls-related incident occurs.

A Substituted Judgement is based on the client\\u2019s previous expressed will and preferences or, if this is unknown, a Representative\\u2019s interpretation of \\u2018what the client would have wanted\\u2019. Supporter is a person or organisation who is designated by the client or organisation to aid in the communication and development of the client\\u2019s wishes regarding their care. Supporters may be required to aid in the decision-making process, however the ultimate decision-making power lies with the client. Procedures Choice Information strategies Information in appropriate formats about the opportunities for client choice will be provided to clients at each major service point from intake to end of service. If clients have literacy or communication issues, then every effort should be made to ensure they understand their rights and opportunities in making decisions regarding services. The information is available in the following documents: \\u2022 Consultation about HHC services \\u2022 Care planning process Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy _POL_V01_2209 2|Page Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy \\u2022 Review of Care Plan \\u2022 Annual Survey \\u2022 Advance care planning \\u2022 Complaints Support to make choices Clients will have the opportunity to make choices about their service in the following ways: \\u2022 service delivery access - types of service available, the days and times a service can be accessed, frequency of attendance, the location, how the service is provided to ensure that it meets individual needs (particularly in terms of physical, cultural or communication needs) \\u2022 individual service planning - expressing preferences for the level or intensity of service, which other services are involved, the ways that personal goals will be achieved, how progress reviews are conducted, and decisions about changes or exiting the service Hope Holistic Care actively supports service users to make choices in the way they use services: \\u2022 follow-up on written information and specific assistance to clients who may experience cultural or language barriers, or who may need specialised advocacy or support to take full advantage of the opportunities, providing information in a range of mediums: written, pictorial, verbal. Record keeping Hope Holistic Care documents all input from clients regarding their service preferences. This is recorded on the client\\u2019s file. Supported Decision making and Dignity of Risk Clients will be provided with access to the support necessary for them to make, communicate and participate in decisions regarding their life and care. Clients should be provided with a Chinese format of this policy and be supported to understand it. Staff will receive information and training on the nature of capacity in decision-making and how to support client decision-making that upholds clients\\u2019 rights. Designating the role of Supporters and Representatives Supporters and Representatives should be designated by or with the consent of the client, and their roles can be formalised into a written decision-making agreement. To avoid conflicts of interest, Supporters and Representatives should preferably not be in a position where they have interests in Hope Holistic Care or any other service provider delivering services to the client, as this may compromise their role. Where this is unavoidable, the written supported decision-making agreement should include a declaration of any conflicts of interest if they exist, and specify how actual or potential conflicts will be managed. Supported decision-making should occur in collaboration with informal support networks such as friends, family, peer support and independent advocates. This will help to create a natural safeguard for the client and prevent Supporters from making decisions which are not in the client\\u2019s best interests. Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy _POL_V01_2209 3|Page Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy Assessing client decision-making capacity Care workers will notify the Case Manager if there are concerns regarding a client\\u2019s decision-making capacity. The Case Manager will assess the situation and discuss with the client and their carer/representative regarding decision making support processes. Suggestions may be made to refer the client to relevant and qualified assessors (e.g. Solicitor, GP, social worker etc) for an assessment to be made to determine the client\\u2019s decision-making capacity. Substituted Judgement If it is determined that the client is unfit to make a decision regarding their life, their will and preferences will be overridden, and a Substituted Judgement will be made by the authorised Representative. This is considered as a last resort. Clients will only receive a Substituted Judgement or have their will and preferences overridden if: \\u2022 They cannot understand any of the risks associated with their decisions; or \\u2022 The proposed decision presents a threat to the wellbeing of the client or others. Supporting decision-making The current or previously expressed will and preferences of the client will be respected and carried out unless they are unlawful, or compromise other rights such as their right to safety, or the rights of others. In the process of supporting a client\\u2019s decision: 1. A client\\u2019s will and preference should be respected and given effect; If will and preference are not known: 2. The Representative(s) must make a decision on what the client would likely want, based on the information available; If it is not possible to determine what the client would likely want: 3. The Representative must act to preserve the client\\u2019s human rights and make the least restrictive decisions regarding those rights. Where clients require assistance in the communication of their will and preference, the organisation will provide the appropriate tools and strategies for the client to express themselves. This may include use of pictures, assistive technology or language services. Staff will support and assist clients to understand the context and consequences of their decisions. Staff will work proactively with clients to establish social histories, life-story work and care plans as documentation which might assist in future decision-making scenarios. Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy _POL_V01_2209 4|Page Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy Dignity of risk Supporters will respect an individual\\u2019s right to the dignity of risk and will not dissuade them from making a decision based on the associated risks alone, whether real or perceived. If a client\\u2019s decision involves some level of risk, Supporters should ensure that the client can foresee and understand the risks associated with the decision. Staff will attempt to manage the risks associated with significant decisions, while not attempting to change the client\\u2019s mind regarding a decision. Process for dealing with perceived conflict of interest If a staff member or person from a client\\u2019s support network believes a Representative or Supporter is not acting in the best interests of a client, they are to notify the Home Care Manager as soon as possible. Following a complaint in relation to an assisted decision, the Home Care Manager will assess whether the Representative or Supporter\\u2019s vested interest in the decision influenced their actions. If it is found that the Supporter or Representative had a vested interest in a decision and the decision made was not in the best interests of the client, they will be removed as a Supporter or Representative. If required, matters involving the abuse of Representative decision-making may be referred to the Guardianship tribunal or the Police or a relevant external body, depending on the situation. Documentation For Substituted Judgements that may have significant immediate and long-term consequences, the decision-making process and outcome will be documented and will be stored in the client\\u2019s case file.

It is particularly common for older Australians living in aged care facilities to experience falls. Hope Holistic Care (HHC) is committed to taking necessary measures to prevent falls and fall-related harm from occurring in our facilities. We will ensure appropriate falls assessment, prevention and management strategies are effectively implemented. We will also ensure that workers are adequately trained on how to assess, identify and mitigate falls. Definitions Syncope (fainting): is a temporary loss of consciousness, often related to insufficient blood flow to the brain. Most commonly occurring when blood pressure is too low, and the heart doesn\\u2019t pump enough oxygen to the brain. Polypharmacy: is the concurrent use of multiple medications by a patient. Vestibular dysfunction: is a common cause of dizziness among the older population. Continence: is the ability of a person to control bowel and bladder movements. Procedures Risk Screening and Assessment HHC will conduct a screening and assessment of all clients in our facilities upon arrival and every six months. This falls risk screening process will be undertaken by a Registered Nurse and will include the following assessment from the best practice guidelines, to determine if the resident is a high or low falls risk. After determining the risk category of each client, an individualised management plan will be developed by Registered staff which outlines the main falls risks and mitigations strategies. The management plan will be used so that all staff are aware of the risks posed to each individual client, and any additional environmental or medical strategies which may need to be implemented. Syncope (fainting) All clients will be assessed for syncope on arrival at the facility. Presyncope, syncope and postural hypotension will be included when developing the client\\u2019s management plan for falls prevention. The root causes of clients who report having unexplained falls or episodes will be identified and addressed. Dizziness and vertigo Clients will be assessed for vestibular dysfunction if they experience dizziness, vertigo or imbalance. Vestibular rehabilitation will be implemented to treat dizziness and balance problems where indicated. Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 1|Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy Vision Clients will receive an eye examination on arrival to determine if they have cataracts. Clients who have severe visual impairments will receive visual aids if necessary, and their environment will be modified accordingly. Client participation HHC will ensure that clients are involved during the falls prevention processes. We will: \\u2022 provide information which frames falls prevention as a means for clients to remain independent for longer; \\u2022 provide information on \\u2018falls prevention\\u2019 to clients in a manner they understand; \\u2022 seek client input in discussions about preventing falls; \\u2022 develop falls prevention programs which accommodate the individual client\\u2019s needs; and \\u2022 identify potential barriers the client may face when taking part in actions to prevent falls. Staff training HHC\\u2019s Registered staff will be trained on how to undertake screening and assessment of new clients to determine if they are a high or low falls risk. The Registered staff will be trained on how to identify potential barriers or hazards which could result in falls and injury. The care staff responsible for assisting clients who wear hip-protectors will undertake relevant training on the correct application of hip protectors. Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 2|Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy Management Strategies Feet and footwear Clients\\u2019 footwear will be reviewed regularly to ensure it meets the safety guidelines. Clients will be encouraged to wear soft soled shoes as opposed to slippers. Clients will also be encouraged to wear footwear when walking, to avoid the increased risk of falling barefoot. The facility will, where possible, provide grip socks to all clients who present a high falls risk, to wear during the night. Clients will be offerreded to be referred to a podiatrist on arrival if they present with foot issues which require specialised attention, who may assist in falls prevention. Environmental considerations HHC will monitor the client\\u2019s environment and be attentive to feedback concerning near misses and recommend mitigation strategies where fall risks are identified, including to report to My Aged Care for reassessment to get assistance with Home modifications. Minimising injuries from falls Hip protectors will be given to clients who require them. HHC will consider the clients\\u2019 falls history, mobility, steadiness, gait, disability status, osteoporosis and body index when deciding whether to use hip-protectors. HHC will also ensure that clients who require assistance to use hip-protectors receive the necessary support. Restraints HHC will not apply restraints at anytime or under any circumstances. If a staff member is at risk of harm, they are advised to exit the client\\u2019s home to a safe place before reporting to the Case manager of office personnel. Observation HHC will work with the client and/or their representative to ensure that higher falls risk clients are closely observed, such as via regular phone calls. Clients with dementia and other clients who have a high risk of falling, will be encouraged to apply devices which can detect their falls and send responses to designated contacts. Continence Clients will also be offered continence assessments to check if they have problems that can be modified or prevented. Improving balance with mobility and exercise HHC will develop tailored physical activity and exercise programs for clients to help strengthen and improve stability, strength and mobility. HHC will assess balance, strength and mobility through a variety of tools and tests. These tests may include: - functional reach - six-metre walk - timed up-and-go - sit-to-stand - spring balance Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203 3|Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy Medication management Case managers, Registered Staff and Care workers should be aware of the medications each client is taking and how those medications effect whether they are a high or low risk patient (e.g. knowing antidepressants are associated with higher risk of falls). HHC will encourage all clients who experience a fall have their medications reviewed by a pharmacist.

The documents provided don't explicitly state a protocol for this exact scenario, but using a combination of policies, here's a general guide to follow: Attempt to Contact the Client: Try calling the client using their preferred method of contact to check if they can respond. Wait and Observe: If there's no response, wait for an appropriate amount of time, keeping an eye out for any sign that the client might be at home and in need of assistance. Contact Your Supervisor: Notify your supervisor or office team about the situation, as they might have additional information or instructions. Emergency Procedures: If you have reason to believe the client may be in immediate danger (for instance, if the client has a history of medical issues that might lead to incapacitation), you might be advised to call emergency services or take additional actions as per the Deterioration Policy and other relevant workplace policies. Document the Incident: Make a record of the time you arrived, the attempts made to contact the client, and all communications and actions taken during the incident. Follow-up: Depending on the response received and the instructions from your supervisor, you may need to return to the client's residence at a later time or date to complete the scheduled visit. Review and Prevention: After the incident, review the situation with your supervisor to determine if there's a need to adjust the client's care plan to prevent similar occurrences in the future, and ensure that any reported issues are resolved . Respect for the Client's Decision: If it is established that the client chose not to answer the door, respect their decision as part of their right to the dignity of risk, while ensuring their safety and well-being are not compromised\\u30102:0\\u2020Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy\\u3011.

      "         \"Data Breach Response Plan V01_2305 TBC Responsibilities and delegations Record of procedure development Version Date of Approved Date for Review This procedure applies to Specific responsibilities Procedure approval All staff with access to personal information CEO, IT Committee IT Committee Data breach response plan Policy Hope Holistic Care is committed to protecting the privacy and personal information that it holds about individuals. Hope Holistic Care will act appropriately and in a timely manner in the event of a data breach, to contain the possible resulting harm and notify individuals affected as required. Definitions Data Breach: When personal information held by an organisation is disclosed accidentally, lost, or accessed without permission. This can be as a result of human error, or through malicious action by an employee or an external party. Examples include where a secure IT system containing personal information has been hacked, a storage device being lost by an employee, or an employee accidentally releasing personal information to the wrong person. Personal information: \\u2018Information about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable: whether the information or opinion is true or not; and whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not.\\u2019 (Privacy Act 1988, Section 6) Procedure Identify When staff have reason to believe there has been a data breach, they should inform the Office immediately. At this time, details such as when and how the breach was discovered, and by whom, should be recorded. This will be recorded in the incident register. Contain As soon as a breach or suspected breach has been identified, any steps to contain or limit the potential harm should be taken. This may include shutting down a system that has been breached, or recovering any records. The CEO will complete a preliminary assessment of the breach and take any immediate action to contain the breach if possible. Assess If the preliminary assessment finds that further investigation and assessment is necessary to understand the nature and extent of the breach, it will be escalated to the data breach response team. The team will work together to gather information, assess risks and the likelihood of serious harm from the breach, and therefore whether it is an \\u2018eligible\\u2019 (notifiable) breach. To evaluate whether a known data breach is notifiable, consider the following three questions: \\u2022 Has there been unauthorised access, unauthorised disclosure, accidental loss, or theft of personal information that the organisation holds? Data Breach Response Plan _POL_V01_2305 1|Page Data breach response plan For example, the organisation\\u2019s database is hacked, a portable storage device containing personal information is lost, or the organisation accidentally releases personal information to the wrong person. \\u2022 Is it likely that this may result in serious harm to individual/s whose data has been breached? This can include but is not limited to psychological, financial, emotional, physical or reputational harm. To be able to accurately assess the likelihood and seriousness of harm, it requires looking at the context of the data and how it may have been breached. For information about the factors to consider when deciding whether harm is likely and/or serious, refer to section 26WG of the Privacy Amendment (Notifiable Data Breaches) Act 2017 \\u2022 Does the likelihood of serious harm remain despite taking available remedial action? The obligation to notify the OAIC can be avoided if the organisation takes remedial action in a timely manner to prevent the risk of harm occurring, either by making the harm unlikely to occur, or non-serious. If the answer to the above three questions is yes, then the breach classifies as an eligible data breach and organisations are required to notify the OAIC and any affected individuals. If there are reasonable grounds to suspect that there has been a data breach, the data response team should conduct an assessment of the suspected breach. The assessment of a suspected breach must take place within 30 days of it occurring, and should seek to find out the likelihood of serious harm occurring as a result of the suspected breach. If it is assessed to be likely, this has the same notification obligations as a known data breach under the NDB Scheme. Take remedial action Remedial action can be taken at any point throughout the data breach response process \\u2013 the sooner the better. However, it may be that the full extent and nature of the breach, and therefore the actions that could be taken, are not known until after assessing and investigating the breach. Examples of remedial action include remotely deleting sensitive information from a laptop which has been lost, or emailing affected individuals with advice to change their password details for an online account for which login information may have been hacked. The data breach response team should document the process of any remedial action, making sure to document rationale and reasoning as to why a certain conclusion has been made. If, after the remedial action has been taken, the risk of harm is reduced so that it is unlikely to occur, or non-serious, then there is no requirement to notify. Even if there is no requirement, however, the data response team should consider whether to contact affected individuals with advice for further protecting their information as a customer service measure. Notify Once a breach has been assessed as eligible, relevant individuals and bodies should be notified as soon as practicable. Notification must include the following information as a minimum: Data Breach Response Plan _POL_V01_2305 2|Page Data breach response plan \\u2022 The organisation\\u2019s name and contact details \\u2022 Description of the data breach \\u2022 Type of information involved in the breach \\u2022 Advice and recommendations for individuals to take in response 1. The OAIC The CEO is responsible for notifying and liaising with the OAIC for data breaches which have been assessed as eligible for the purposes of the Notifiable Data Breaches Scheme, using the OAIC\\u2019s Notifiable Data Breach form. 2. Notification of individuals who are at likely risk of serious harm due to the data breach The way notification occurs will depend on the context and nature of the breach, and the relationship of the individuals affected to the organisation. It should occur as soon as practicable after completing the notification statement for the OAIC. Individuals may be contacted by phone and email. A public notification may also occur. Notification to affected individuals may contain an explanation of what happened to their personal information, an apology, description of what measures have been put in place as a result of the breach, and advice on what they can do to further protect their information. Record and review Data breach log A data breach log will record all instances of data breaches or suspected breaches, as well as document assessments of the breach and any changes made as a result of a breach. All staff should be made aware of the log, and the CEO will be responsible for ensuring that all breaches or suspected breaches are recorded accurately in the log. Review Whether or not the breach or suspected breach was notifiable, a review should be conducted into processes relating to the breach to strengthen protections in the future. Depending on the type and seriousness of the breach, this may include: \\u2022 A full investigation into how the breach occurred \\u2022 Implement measures to ensure it does not reoccur, documented in a prevention plan \\u2022 Reviews of security, cybersecurity and ICT policies and procedures \\u2022 Audit of implementation of relevant policies and procedures \\u2022 Additional staff training about privacy and data breach responses Data Breach Response Plan _POL_V01_2305 3|Page\",\n",
