Although client rectified with Services Australia on December 6, the MAC account did not reflect this up until post January. Deductions from bank account did not take place until after their initial credit of funds transferred from previous provider was exhausted. This happened in January 2022. Three transactions totalling approximately $1,000 was deducted from the client's bank account by AAH in that month, causing client to panic and request immediate cessation of services. AAH was due to reconcile accounts with Government statement in February.<br />Client side:<br />- Concerns about their financial outgoings and delayed reconciliation of funds from the previous provider<br />- Expectations of accessibility to provider contact arising from previous provider, who operated close by<br />- Client\u2019s inability to understand the statement<br />- Rectification of accounts not occurring at a time consistent with letter from Department to Sue advising otherwise<br />- English as second language, resulting in matters of understanding<br />AAH-HHC<br />- The financial statement not being easily understood<br />- AAH had high turnover of Case managers<br />- The transfer of funds from the previous provider not being recognised until December<br />Externalities <br />- Services Australia\u2019s income tested fee error, which saw Sue charged at the highest rate<br />- IPA implementation - Direct Debits occurring on a month-by-month basis in lump-sum instead of consistent fortnightly deductions after September 2021",
