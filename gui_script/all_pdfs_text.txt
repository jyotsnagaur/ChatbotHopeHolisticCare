Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy  
1 | Page Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy _POL_V01_2209  Policy Client Decision Making and Choice Hope Holistic Care is committed to empowering clients to play an active role in decisions that affect their lives and to make choices for themselves: The organisation will: • inform clients about the opportunities for choice available to them  • support clients to make informed choices which will provide them opportunities  • keep records of client preferences regarding their service • enable clients to build self-reliance and maintain social inclusion  Supported Decision-Making and Dignity of Risk Hope Holistic Care acknowledges that all clients have a human right to make decisions about their own life and to have those decisions respected. Hope Holistic Care understands and affirms that cognitive impairment is not a reason for a person to be excluded from the decision-making process about their own life.   Hope Holistic Care understands that not all decisions require assistance and will support clients primarily when they make significant decisions which have immediate or long-term consequences regarding their health, finances or lifestyle.  Hope Holistic Care is committed to supporting clients with complex care and communication needs to make their own decisions regarding their life.  The will and preferences of a client will only be overridden if a decision is deemed by staff or advocates to be dangerous to the wellbeing of the client or others. Definitions Decision is a planned course of action, either short or long term, regarding the lifestyle, healthcare or financial affairs of an individual. Dignity of risk is the recognition that every individual should be able to do something that has a level of risk involved, whether real or perceived. Financial Decisions include but are not limited to: • Investment decisions; • Sale or gifts of property or valuable possessions; • Use of money. Functional Capacity Assessment is an assessment of an individual’s decision-making capacity in the present moment. The assessment should focus on the person’s understanding of the decision, its context and consequences, and should not contain a judgement on whether a person’s decision is wise or unwise. Healthcare Decisions include but are not limited to: • Seeking or obtaining a diagnosis; 
Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy  
2 | Page Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy _POL_V01_2209  • Accessing (or refusing) care services; • Responding to crisis (falls, incidents); • Agreeing or refusing medical treatment; • Advance care planning. Lifestyle Decisions include but are not limited to: • Living arrangements; • Relationships; • Employment; • Civic participation; • Holidays and outings; • Pets and possessions. Representative is a person or organisation that assists the client in the decision-making process and, where necessary, makes decisions on behalf of the client. A Representative is designated by a client, or by appointment from another body if the client is unfit to nominate a Representative, and includes a Substitute Decision Maker.  Substitute Decision Maker (guardian) is a legally appointed person such as a guardian to make decisions on behalf of a client in certain areas, for example Healthcare Decisions and Lifestyle Decisions, or a financial manager to make Financial Decisions. A Substitute Decision Maker should work with a client’s informal support networks to support a client to build their decision-making capacity.  Substituted Judgement is a decision made by a Representative regarding a client who is unable to communicate their will and preferences, or when a client’s will and preferences infringe on their rights or the rights of others. A Substituted Judgement is based on the client’s previous expressed will and preferences or, if this is unknown, a Representative’s interpretation of ‘what the client would have wanted’. Supporter is a person or organisation who is designated by the client or organisation to aid in the communication and development of the client’s wishes regarding their care. Supporters may be required to aid in the decision-making process, however the ultimate decision-making power lies with the client. Procedures Choice Information strategies  Information in appropriate formats about the opportunities for client choice will be provided to clients at each major service point from intake to end of service. If clients have literacy or communication issues, then every effort should be made to ensure they understand their rights and opportunities in making decisions regarding services. The information is available in the following documents: • Consultation about HHC services • Care planning process 
Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy  
3 | Page Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy _POL_V01_2209  • Review of Care Plan • Annual Survey • Advance care planning • Complaints  Support to make choices Clients will have the opportunity to make choices about their service in the following ways: • service delivery access - types of service available, the days and times a service can be accessed, frequency of attendance, the location, how the service is provided to ensure that it meets individual needs (particularly in terms of physical, cultural or communication needs)  • individual service planning - expressing preferences for the level or intensity of service, which other services are involved, the ways that personal goals will be achieved, how progress reviews are conducted, and decisions about changes or exiting the service  Hope Holistic Care actively supports service users to make choices in the way they use services: • follow-up on written information and specific assistance to clients who may experience cultural or language barriers, or who may need specialised advocacy or support to take full advantage of the opportunities, providing information in a range of mediums: written, pictorial, verbal.   Record keeping Hope Holistic Care documents all input from clients regarding their service preferences. This is recorded on the client’s file.  Supported Decision making and Dignity of Risk Clients will be provided with access to the support necessary for them to make, communicate and participate in decisions regarding their life and care. Clients should be provided with a Chinese format of this policy and be supported to understand it.  Staff will receive information and training on the nature of capacity in decision-making and how to support client decision-making that upholds clients’ rights.  Designating the role of Supporters and Representatives  Supporters and Representatives should be designated by or with the consent of the client, and their roles can be formalised into a written decision-making agreement.  To avoid conflicts of interest, Supporters and Representatives should preferably not be in a position where they have interests in Hope Holistic Care or any other service provider delivering services to the client, as this may compromise their role. Where this is unavoidable, the written supported decision-making agreement should include a declaration of any conflicts of interest if they exist, and specify how actual or potential conflicts will be managed.   Supported decision-making should occur in collaboration with informal support networks such as friends, family, peer support and independent advocates. This will help to create a natural safeguard for the client and prevent Supporters from making decisions which are not in the client’s best interests.  
Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy  
4 | Page Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy _POL_V01_2209   Assessing client decision-making capacity Care workers will notify the Case Manager if there are concerns regarding a client’s decision-making capacity. The Case Manager will assess the situation and discuss with the client and their carer/representative regarding decision making support processes. Suggestions may be made to refer the client to relevant and qualified assessors (e.g. Solicitor, GP, social worker etc) for an assessment to be made to determine the client’s decision-making capacity.  Substituted Judgement If it is determined that the client is unfit to make a decision regarding their life, their will and preferences will be overridden, and a Substituted Judgement will be made by the authorised Representative. This is considered as a last resort. Clients will only receive a Substituted Judgement or have their will and preferences overridden if:  • They cannot understand any of the risks associated with their decisions; or • The proposed decision presents a threat to the wellbeing of the client or others.   Supporting decision-making The current or previously expressed will and preferences of the client will be respected and carried out unless they are unlawful, or compromise other rights such as their right to safety, or the rights of others. In the process of supporting a client’s decision: 1. A client’s will and preference should be respected and given effect;  If will and preference are not known: 2. The Representative(s) must make a decision on what the client would likely want, based on the information available; If it is not possible to determine what the client would likely want: 3. The Representative must act to preserve the client’s human rights and make the least restrictive decisions regarding those rights. Where clients require assistance in the communication of their will and preference, the organisation will provide the appropriate tools and strategies for the client to express themselves. This may include use of pictures, assistive technology or language services. Staff will support and assist clients to understand the context and consequences of their decisions.  Staff will work proactively with clients to establish social histories, life-story work and care plans as documentation which might assist in future decision-making scenarios.   
Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy  
5 | Page Decision Making, Choice and Dignity of Risk Policy _POL_V01_2209  Dignity of risk Supporters will respect an individual’s right to the dignity of risk and will not dissuade them from making a decision based on the associated risks alone, whether real or perceived. If a client’s decision involves some level of risk, Supporters should ensure that the client can foresee and understand the risks associated with the decision. Staff will attempt to manage the risks associated with significant decisions, while not attempting to change the client’s mind regarding a decision. Process for dealing with perceived conflict of interest If a staff member or person from a client’s support network believes a Representative or Supporter is not acting in the best interests of a client, they are to notify the Home Care Manager as soon as possible. Following a complaint in relation to an assisted decision, the Home Care Manager will assess whether the Representative or Supporter’s vested interest in the decision influenced their actions. If it is found that the Supporter or Representative had a vested interest in a decision and the decision made was not in the best interests of the client, they will be removed as a Supporter or Representative.  If required, matters involving the abuse of Representative decision-making may be referred to the Guardianship tribunal or the Police or a relevant external body, depending on the situation. Documentation For Substituted Judgements that may have significant immediate and long-term consequences, the decision-making process and outcome will be documented and will be stored in the client’s case file.

We need to remember to protect their confidentiality, and only share information to those who are also involved with their care. Before sharing any information, think about why you are sharing it. If it is necessary, be mindful to share only what needs to be known for that purpose. Also, think about whether you would like others talking about you in the same way. This applies to our colleagues and company information as well. Remember that we entrust each other with our information so that we can help meet each other’s needs.  “Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen.”  Ephesians 4:29  If you want to know more about this subject, you can access our Privacy Policy or talk to your manager about it. Safety, Security and Abuse When clients open their home to us, they are giving us a lot of power. We need to be mindful of this and use it responsibly. In everything we do or say, it’s important that we do so safely, as well as making them feel safe and secure. Abuse can occur when we come across as threatening, disrespectful; when we ignore their needs; when we touch them inappropriately; when we use physical force, or take advantage of their belongings, such as money. It is best that we treat our clients and colleagues with respect and humility. We need to show our concern for them by asking them if they feel safe and take actions if they say otherwise. “Do not devise harm against your neighbour, while he lives securely beside you.” Proverbs 3:29  If you want to find out more, you can refer to our Abuse and Neglect Policy or talk to your manager about it. Appearance Appearance can affect the comfort of clients we serve as well as what they think of the organisation. Therefore, we should always dress appropriately, being presentable, professional, clean, neat and tidy. All Care staff will be supplied with at least one HHC uniform shirt by the Office. Please use it and wash regularly. Appearance Guidelines Please follow the below guidelines: • Identification badges should be worn to let clients know your name 
Staff Handbook  
3 | Page Staff Handbook  • In general, shoes should be sturdy, low heeled, protect the foot and have slip-resistant soles. We will wear shoe covers when we enter client’s homes. • Uniforms are expected to be clean, tidy and not appear scrunched up. Hair When providing direct care, please tie your hair back if it is longer than shoulder length for hygiene purposes. Personal Items We should only be bringing what we need into the house. Consider bringing a small bag and keep it near the entrance of the home. This is to prevent suspicions of theft by the client. Try not to bring many personal items into the residence.  Jewellery/Nails For safety purposes, when providing care, we should not wear rings (other than wedding bands), bracelets (other than medical alert bracelets), very long fingernails, nail polish, drop earrings and necklaces. Ear studs may be worn. This is to preserve the skin integrity of our clients and prevent unnecessary injury. Mobile phones We should generally refrain from using our mobile phones for personal reasons when working with a client. It is best to be kept in your bag so that you can pay attention to the client. If you are expecting an important call, notify the client in advance and minimise the time spent on the call. Smoking For the health and safety of our clients and colleagues, all working environments, including the client’s house and surrounds, are smoke-free. We encourage all staff to refrain from smoking whilst on shift and/or whilst travelling between clients. Hygiene and Infection Control Our clients can get very sick if they are infected with viruses or bacteria into their home. For the safety of them and us, we should keep ourselves clean and use personal protective equipment at appropriate times. This includes regular hand sanitisation, mask and glove wearing. You should always have these supplies with you. If you need to replenish them, please contact the office and we will arrange to deliver these to you. Please read the Infection Prevention and Control Policy and talk to your manager if you have any questions. Work Health and Safety Your health and safety are important to HHC. HHC is committed to the following: • Regularly talk to you and ask you about work health and safety • Develop safe procedures for everyone to use every day, including for emergencies • Provide reporting systems and injury management What we need you to do is to: • Use of the Home Safety Checklist at the client’s home before services start • Take care for the safety of yourself and others 
Staff Handbook  
4 | Page Staff Handbook  • Comply with health and safety directions • Report incidents and injury immediately • Report and control hazards as you identify them, and report to management as needed Learning and Development We learn by experience and seeking answers to questions that come up in what we do each day. Therefore, HHC will actively encourage individual staff to reflect on the clients and services to identify opportunities for learning. We also organise group education sessions on topics that have been raised through client needs, staff requests and as required by industry standards or legislation. Employee relations Probation For Permanent or full-time staff, we generally provide a probationary period of 3 months, unless there is written notice from us to indicate otherwise. Payroll Enquiries Hope Holistic Care operates on a fortnightly pay cycle.

Therefore, it is able to offer full-time and part-time employees salary packaging – reimbursing employees’ bills (tax free) up to $15,900 per annum. For more information, please contact the Office. Travel When visiting clients, the first trip to the client from your home and the last trip returning home will not be included in the mileage reimbursement. We will calculate the mileage for travel between the clients based on Google Maps and automatically pay you as travel allowance. If you assist the client with transportation or shopping during the visit, you will be able to report it in the app to claim reimbursement. Unless specified, there will not be any reimbursement for tolls paid during the travel to clients’ homes. Parking fines or any traffic infringements are not payable by HHC. Discrimination and Harassment Hope Holistic Care strives to maintain a working environment free from all forms of harassment or intimidation. Threatening, insulting or abusive words or behaviour towards another, or by displaying threatening, insulting or abusive words or pictures, unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favours and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature are serious violations of our policy and will not be condoned or permitted. HHC will not tolerate behaviour which is offensive, intimidating, humiliating, malicious, insulting or embarrassing and which is aimed at making an individual or group of individuals feel miserable, humiliated or lacking in self-confidence. It is expected that people in our workplace will behave in accordance with our Code of Ethical Behaviour.

Abuse and Neglect Policy  
1 | Page Abuse and Neglect Policy _POL_V01_2209  Policy Hope Holistic Care is committed to taking all steps possible to prevent and respond to abuse, neglect, exploitation, violence and discrimination of its clients, particularly toward older people.  Hope Holistic Care will promote and adhere to the human rights of all clients and empower them to exercise their rights. Hope Holistic Care is committed to creating a culture where client safety is essential to service delivery, and clients and workers feel empowered to speak up and report abuse.   Hope Holistic Care will outline the processes to: • Assess the risks of abuse  • Prevent abuse from occurring • Respond to abuse Definitions Exploitation: is taking advantage of someone’s vulnerabilities for your personal gain, to steal, use or profit. Exploitation often occurs with vulnerable groups such as people with a disability and older people. Exploitation is a form of abuse. Abuse: is any form of violence, coercion, exploitation, discrimination, harm or neglect which causes another person psychological or physical pain or suffering. Abuse can be emotional, physical, financial, chemical or sexual. Procedures Assessing risks of abuse: Workers will be trained to identify and respond to factors which may heighten the risk of clients being a victim of abuse. Workers will consider, for each client, the factors that can contribute to client vulnerability, such as social and geographical isolation, insecure accommodation, dependency on carers, not having the means or capacity to advocate for themselves, fragility and dysfunctional family lives.  Preventing abuse Organisational commitment to prevention Hope Holistic Care has preventative measures in place to ensure that individuals are free from discrimination, exploitation, abuse, harm, neglect and violence. This includes policy and practice that protect people’s rights, and a commitment to empowering individuals by informing them about the rights that they possess.  The organisation will foster a culture where all workers are committed to preventing abuse. All workers will undertake training in abuse prevention and client rights. Hope Holistic Care will ensure the staff recruitment screening process is thorough.  Hope Holistic Care will take a holistic and system wide approach to preventing abuse in all services and activities. Hope Holistic Care will ensure that staff, feel supported and their wellbeing is looked after.  
Abuse and Neglect Policy  
2 | Page Abuse and Neglect Policy _POL_V01_2209  Culture of reporting and transparency Hope Holistic Care will create a culture where workers and clients feel supported to speak up when they witness or become aware of information about an alleged abuse, and that they feel they can do so without fear of punishment or retribution. Barriers to both client and worker disclosure of incidents of abuse will be addressed and mitigated. Hope Holistic Care will develop clear Whistleblower protections to encourage transparency and prevent abuse from going unreported. Refer to Policy: Whistleblower protection Feedback  Hope Holistic Care will ensure there are adequate feedback and complaints mechanisms in place and all clients are aware of how to lodge a complaint or provide feedback. Official feedback processes will not act as the sole mechanism for clients to raise issues around abuse, exploitation, violence, neglect and discrimination. Responsibilities Case Managers will: • Ensure clients understand their rights and are aware of how they can exercise them; • Listen to and validate a client’s experience when they report a suspected abuse; • Talk to the client about what is most important to them when responding to the abuse; • Involve the client as much as they would like in the investigation and decision-making processes; • Ensure the client and their family, where appropriate, are informed on all measures being taken; • Give regular updates on the progress of the investigation; • Arrange access to counselling or support for both the client and workers who may be suffering as a result of the incident; • Analyse and identify what went wrong to allow the abuse to occur, and what changes can be made in organisational policies and procedures to combat abuse; and • Ensure that all workers sign a Code of Conduct, which requires workers to respect and maintain the dignity of clients.  Responding to abuse Hope Holistic Care will apply the following principles when responding to abuse: • Client safety is paramount to all procedures • Clients will be treated with dignity and respect • Clients will have the right to self-determination • Workers understand and enact their duty of care  • Workers have undertaken cultural competency training and are considerate of individual client cultural differences • A holistic approach will be taken when responding to abuse

       Data Breach Response Plan Record of procedure development Version Date of Approved Date for Review V01_2305 TBC      Responsibilities and delegations This procedure applies to All staff with access to personal information  Specific responsibilities CEO, IT Committee Procedure approval IT Committee            
Data breach response plan 
1 | Page Data Breach Response Plan _POL_V01_2305  Policy Hope Holistic Care is committed to protecting the privacy and personal information that it holds about individuals. Hope Holistic Care will act appropriately and in a timely manner in the event of a data breach, to contain the possible resulting harm and notify individuals affected as required.  Definitions Data Breach: When personal information held by an organisation is disclosed accidentally, lost, or accessed without permission. This can be as a result of human error, or through malicious action by an employee or an external party.   Examples include where a secure IT system containing personal information has been hacked, a storage device being lost by an employee, or an employee accidentally releasing personal information to the wrong person.  Personal information: ‘Information about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable: whether the information or opinion is true or not; and whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not.’ (Privacy Act 1988, Section 6) Procedure Identify When staff have reason to believe there has been a data breach, they should inform the Office immediately.  At this time, details such as when and how the breach was discovered, and by whom, should be recorded. This will be recorded in the incident register. Contain As soon as a breach or suspected breach has been identified, any steps to contain or limit the potential harm should be taken. This may include shutting down a system that has been breached, or recovering any records.   The CEO will complete a preliminary assessment of the breach and take any immediate action to contain the breach if possible.  Assess If the preliminary assessment finds that further investigation and assessment is necessary to understand the nature and extent of the breach, it will be escalated to the data breach response team. The team will work together to gather information, assess risks and the likelihood of serious harm from the breach, and therefore whether it is an ‘eligible’ (notifiable) breach.  To evaluate whether a known data breach is notifiable, consider the following three questions: • Has there been unauthorised access, unauthorised disclosure, accidental loss, or theft of personal information that the organisation holds?  
Data breach response plan 
2 | Page Data Breach Response Plan _POL_V01_2305  For example, the organisation’s database is hacked, a portable storage device containing personal information is lost, or the organisation accidentally releases personal information to the wrong person.  • Is it likely that this may result in serious harm to individual/s whose data has been breached?   This can include but is not limited to psychological, financial, emotional, physical or reputational harm. To be able to accurately assess the likelihood and seriousness of harm, it requires looking at the context of the data and how it may have been breached.  For information about the factors to consider when deciding whether harm is likely and/or serious, refer to section 26WG of the Privacy Amendment (Notifiable Data Breaches) Act 2017 • Does the likelihood of serious harm remain despite taking available remedial action? The obligation to notify the OAIC can be avoided if the organisation takes remedial action in a timely manner to prevent the risk of harm occurring, either by making the harm unlikely to occur, or non-serious.   If the answer to the above three questions is yes, then the breach classifies as an eligible data breach and organisations are required to notify the OAIC and any affected individuals.  If there are reasonable grounds to suspect that there has been a data breach, the data response team should conduct an assessment of the suspected breach. The assessment of a suspected breach must take place within 30 days of it occurring, and should seek to find out the likelihood of serious harm occurring as a result of the suspected breach. If it is assessed to be likely, this has the same notification obligations as a known data breach under the NDB Scheme.  Take remedial action Remedial action can be taken at any point throughout the data breach response process – the sooner the better. However, it may be that the full extent and nature of the breach, and therefore the actions that could be taken, are not known until after assessing and investigating the breach.  Examples of remedial action include remotely deleting sensitive information from a laptop which has been lost, or emailing affected individuals with advice to change their password details for an online account for which login information may have been hacked.  The data breach response team should document the process of any remedial action, making sure to document rationale and reasoning as to why a certain conclusion has been made.  If, after the remedial action has been taken, the risk of harm is reduced so that it is unlikely to occur, or non-serious, then there is no requirement to notify.  Even if there is no requirement, however, the data response team should consider whether to contact affected individuals with advice for further protecting their information as a customer service measure.  Notify Once a breach has been assessed as eligible, relevant individuals and bodies should be notified as soon as practicable. Notification must include the following information as a minimum: 
Data breach response plan 
3 | Page Data Breach Response Plan _POL_V01_2305  • The organisation’s name and contact details • Description of the data breach • Type of information involved in the breach • Advice and recommendations for individuals to take in response  1. The OAIC The CEO is responsible for notifying and liaising with the OAIC for data breaches which have been assessed as eligible for the purposes of the Notifiable Data Breaches Scheme, using the OAIC’s Notifiable Data Breach form.  2. Notification of individuals who are at likely risk of serious harm due to the data breach The way notification occurs will depend on the context and nature of the breach, and the relationship of the individuals affected to the organisation. It should occur as soon as practicable after completing the notification statement for the OAIC. Individuals may be contacted by phone and email. A public notification may also occur. Notification to affected individuals may contain an explanation of what happened to their personal information, an apology, description of what measures have been put in place as a result of the breach, and advice on what they can do to further protect their information.  Record and review  Data breach log  A data breach log will record all instances of data breaches or suspected breaches, as well as document assessments of the breach and any changes made as a result of a breach.  All staff should be made aware of the log, and the CEO will be responsible for ensuring that all breaches or suspected breaches are recorded accurately in the log.  Review Whether or not the breach or suspected breach was notifiable, a review should be conducted into processes relating to the breach to strengthen protections in the future. Depending on the type and seriousness of the breach, this may include: • A full investigation into how the breach occurred • Implement measures to ensure it does not reoccur, documented in a prevention plan • Reviews of security, cybersecurity and ICT policies and procedures • Audit of implementation of relevant policies and procedures • Additional staff training about privacy and data breach responses

Deterioration Policy 
1 | Page Deterioration Policy_POL_V1_2303 Policy  Hope Holistic Care is committed to comply with The National Consensus Statement to respond to acute physiological deterioration (Standard 3 (3)(d)).  The National Consensus Statement consists of  essential elements for recognising and responding to acute physiological deterioration (third edition) November 2021 (Essential elements recognising and responding - acute physiological deterioration third edition) is used as the basis for this policy and procedure. It is acknowledged that the scope of the consensus statement relates to acute health services. However, the Consensus Statement ‘focuses on ensuring that a clinical safety net is in place for patients whose physiological condition is acutely deteriorating, and outlines the organisational supports that are needed to provide this safety net.’ The essential elements identified are used as a framework to ensure timely identification of client deterioration to support their clinical safety.    Each contact with our clients is an opportunity to observe and monitor their wellbeing. The client should be the focus of each staff member’s contact with information sought in relation to their wellbeing.  Procedure The essential elements include clinical processes and organisational prerequisites as follows: 1. Measurement and documentation of vital signs and other observations 2. Diagnosis 3. Escalation of care 4. Rapid response systems 5. Communicating for safety 6. Leadership and governance 7. Education and training 8. Evaluation, audit and feedback 9. Systems to support high-quality care Measurement and documentation of vital signs and other observations • Client and/or representative o To advise of any changes in health or health concerns o To have a thermometer available for monitoring of temperature. • Staff providing home services and social support o To ask questions in relation to wellbeing o To observe any changes in health, mobility or cognition o Discuss these with the client and their representative o To accurately document observations in care notes and discuss these with their supervisor. • Care staff and allied health o To ask questions in relation to wellbeing o To observe any changes in health, mobility or cognition  o Use client’s thermometer to take temperature and support the client to undertake a Rapid Antigen Test if this is considered warranted 
Deterioration Policy 
2 | Page Deterioration Policy_POL_V1_2303 o Allied health to undertake assessments within their scope of practice. o Discuss observations and results of these with the client and their representative o Accurately document observations in care notes and discuss these with their Case manager or clinical staff. • Registered Nurses/Clinical Staff o To ask questions in relation to wellbeing o To observe any changes in health, mobility or cognition  o Use client’s thermometer to take temperature and support the client to undertake a Rapid Antigen Test if this is considered warranted.  o Take vital observations and blood glucose level if glucometer available and this is warranted. o Discuss observations and results of these where they vary from the client’s expected normal range with the client and their representative o Accurately document observations in care notes and discuss these with medical practitioner as appropriate. Diagnosis – all roles • Decision support where care is time critical is essential. Consider the following: o The client/representative making an appointment to see their medical practitioner o Speaking to the registered nurse or call HealthDirect on 1800 022 222 o Speaking to the medical practitioner o Dialling 000 to call an ambulance. Escalation of care – all roles • This should be a graded response and should take into account the client’s health status, absolute changes in vital signs or other observations as well as the rate of change over time. • The client must be consulted in relation to their care and supported to make a decision about possible hospitalisation/emergency treatment.  • Where a client has an advance care plan and is not able to communicate their wishes,  their representative should make a decision in relation to escalation of care. This may include consultation with their medical practitioner and the client.  Rapid response systems – all staff • Where severe deterioration occurs all staff should call 000 immediately. • Those staff who have completed Basic Life Support training and who feel confident to do so, should commence life support if the client has indicated they are for resuscitation.  • Where a client has indicated they do not wish to be resuscitated (and has capacity to make this decision; or there is a valid advanced care directive), this should be respected and the ambulance awaited. If uncertain have a low threshold to seek urgent help/assistance.  • Staff are to advise the office and are to remain with the client until the ambulance attends.  • Where the client dies or has died and the ambulance has been called, staff are to wait until the ambulance attends to certify the client’s death.  • If the client is found dead staff are to contact the office, the representative and the medical practitioner.

Feedback and complaints provide us with valuable information that helps us to resolve customer issues, and to understand where we are doing well, and where we can improve.  Feedback is information about reactions to a product, action or service. Feedback may be a query, request, or a compliment.    A complaint is a formal statement that something is unsatisfactory or unacceptable  This policy should be read in conjunction with the Feedback and Complaints Resolution procedure. 2. Scope  This policy applies to all feedback and complaints that relate to HHC’s products or services (including employees, volunteers and contractors delivering those services) or how we manage customers’ personal information.  This policy does not apply to: • grievances between two (or more) employees, that does not impact a customer (see Grievance Management policy) • investigation of internal fraud–related complaints (see Fraud Prevention and Control policy). 3. Policy  HHC is committed to being open and responsive to any feedback and complaints offered by our clients, their carers or advocates, or the broader community.  HHC will maintain a Feedback and Complaints Resolution System, to ensure that all feedback and complaints are considered and resolved in a timely and impartial fashion. HHC will maintain a register of all feedback and complaints information, that will provide transparency regarding how feedback and complaints are managed. This register will be centrally managed by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO).  HHC encourages parties who have feedback or complaints in relation to the services they have received, the management of their personal information or the actions of our employees or volunteers, to raise it directly with us. HHC will make it as easy as possible for people to provide feedback and complaints, by:  • providing information about the feedback and complaints resolution processes, in easy-to-understand formats, on the HHC’s website and at the office location;

Falls Prevention and Management Policy  
1 | Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203  Policy Falls-related injuries are one of the leading causes of mortality in older Australians. It is particularly common for older Australians living in aged care facilities to experience falls.    Hope Holistic Care (HHC) is committed to taking necessary measures to prevent falls and fall-related harm from occurring in our facilities. We will ensure appropriate falls assessment, prevention and management strategies are effectively implemented. We will also ensure that workers are adequately trained on how to assess, identify and mitigate falls.  Definitions Syncope (fainting): is a temporary loss of consciousness, often related to insufficient blood flow to the brain. Most commonly occurring when blood pressure is too low, and the heart doesn’t pump enough oxygen to the brain.  Polypharmacy: is the concurrent use of multiple medications by a patient.  Vestibular dysfunction: is a common cause of dizziness among the older population.  Continence: is the ability of a person to control bowel and bladder movements.  Procedures Risk Screening and Assessment HHC will conduct a screening and assessment of all clients in our facilities upon arrival and every six months. This falls risk screening process will be undertaken by a Registered Nurse and will include the following assessment from the best practice guidelines, to determine if the resident is a high or low falls risk. After determining the risk category of each client, an individualised management plan will be developed by Registered staff which outlines the main falls risks and mitigations strategies. The management plan will be used so that all staff are aware of the risks posed to each individual client, and any additional environmental or medical strategies which may need to be implemented.  Syncope (fainting) All clients will be assessed for syncope on arrival at the facility. Presyncope, syncope and postural hypotension will be included when developing the client’s management plan for falls prevention. The root causes of clients who report having unexplained falls or episodes will be identified and addressed. Dizziness and vertigo Clients will be assessed for vestibular dysfunction if they experience dizziness, vertigo or imbalance. Vestibular rehabilitation will be implemented to treat dizziness and balance problems where indicated.   
Falls Prevention and Management Policy  
2 | Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203  Vision Clients will receive an eye examination on arrival to determine if they have cataracts. Clients who have severe visual impairments will receive visual aids if necessary, and their environment will be modified accordingly. 
 Client participation HHC will ensure that clients are involved during the falls prevention processes. We will: • provide information which frames falls prevention as a means for clients to remain independent for longer; • provide information on ‘falls prevention’ to clients in a manner they understand; • seek client input in discussions about preventing falls; • develop falls prevention programs which accommodate the individual client’s needs; and • identify potential barriers the client may face when taking part in actions to prevent falls.  Staff training HHC’s Registered staff will be trained on how to undertake screening and assessment of new clients to determine if they are a high or low falls risk. The Registered staff will be trained on how to identify potential barriers or hazards which could result in falls and injury. The care staff responsible for assisting clients who wear hip-protectors will undertake relevant training on the correct application of hip protectors. 

Falls Prevention and Management Policy  
3 | Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203  Management Strategies Feet and footwear Clients’ footwear will be reviewed regularly to ensure it meets the safety guidelines. Clients will be encouraged to wear soft soled shoes as opposed to slippers. Clients will also be encouraged to wear footwear when walking, to avoid the increased risk of falling barefoot. The facility will, where possible, provide grip socks to all clients who present a high falls risk, to wear during the night. Clients will be offerreded to be referred to a podiatrist on arrival if they present with foot issues which require specialised attention, who may assist in falls prevention. Environmental considerations HHC will monitor the client’s environment and be attentive to feedback concerning near misses and recommend mitigation strategies where fall risks are identified, including to report to My Aged Care for reassessment to get assistance with Home modifications. Minimising injuries from falls Hip protectors will be given to clients who require them. HHC will consider the clients’ falls history, mobility, steadiness, gait, disability status, osteoporosis and body index when deciding whether to use hip-protectors. HHC will also ensure that clients who require assistance to use hip-protectors receive the necessary support.  Restraints HHC will not apply restraints at anytime or under any circumstances. If a staff member is at risk of harm, they are advised to exit the client’s home to a safe place before reporting to the Case manager of office personnel. Observation HHC will work with the client and/or their representative to ensure that higher falls risk clients are closely observed, such as via regular phone calls. Clients with dementia and other clients who have a high risk of falling, will be encouraged to apply devices which can detect their falls and send responses to designated contacts. Continence Clients will also be offered continence assessments to check if they have problems that can be modified or prevented. Improving balance with mobility and exercise HHC will develop tailored physical activity and exercise programs for clients to help strengthen and improve stability, strength and mobility.  HHC will assess balance, strength and mobility through a variety of tools and tests. These tests may include: - functional reach - six-metre walk - timed up-and-go - sit-to-stand  - spring balance  
Falls Prevention and Management Policy  
4 | Page Falls Prevention and Management Policy _POL_V01_2203  Medication management Case managers, Registered Staff and Care workers should be aware of the medications each client is taking and how those medications effect whether they are a high or low risk patient (e.g. knowing antidepressants are associated with higher risk of falls).  HHC will encourage all clients who experience a fall have their medications reviewed by a pharmacist. Responding to Falls All clients who have a fall, will undergo a post-fall assessment taken by Registered staff. All falls will be documented and recorded by Registered staff.

Background  
Hope Holistic Care (HHC) is an ACNC approved charity and public benevolent institution (PBI).  We can 
offer our employees salary packaging, an ATO -approved benefit whom can take advantage of the tax 
savings.  
 
Who can have salary packaging?  
All HHC employees, including permanent full time, part time and casuals  are entitled to have salary 
packaging .  
 
How does salary packaging work?  
By choosing to salary package, you allocate a portion of your income to the payment of certain expenses 
before your income tax is calculated. The part of your income that you allocate to salary packaging can be 
used for the same everyday items you pay for today, such as : 
- rent or mortgage payments  
- credit card and personal loan repayments  
- expenses via the Everyday P urchases Card  
- school fees and much more  
Because you only pay tax on the remaining amount, you pay less tax and increase your take home pay.  
Even if you have a HELP/HECS debt you could benefit from salary packaging.  
 
How much salary can you  packag e annual ly? 
Salary packaging limits are set for a Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT) year.  
The FBT year runs from 1 April to 31 March, you can salary package up to $15,900 each Fringe Benefit Tax 
(FBT) year or $611.53 per fortnight f or general living expenses.  An additiona l benefit in your first year is 
that if you start salary  packaging part way through the FBT year, you can still package the full annual 
amount between then and 31 March (we call this maximising).

Grievance Management Procedure_PRO_V01_2 201 
 Step One  Informal Grievance Procedure  
HHC encourages, where possible, that a grievance be managed informally. Sometimes people  
behave inappropriately without realising, or make decisions without considering the repercussions. 
Telling the person will give them the chance to stop or change what  they are doing.  
 
The following steps should be followed for this step:  
a) If you have a grievance at work, do not ignore the problem.  
b) Speak to the person who you believe to be the cause of the grievance, explaining how 
you feel as soon as practicable after the problem has arisen.  
 
If the grievance is about their behaviour, tell them that it is not acceptable, it is 
offensive, unsuitable or hurtful.  
 
If it is about a work decision, tell them why you think it is unfair, inappropriate etc.  
c) Keep a diary note of the date and content of the discussion and if there were any 
witnesses present  
d) If the behaviour persists or if no agreement can be achieved, you are able to lodge a 
formal complaint as outlined below  
 
 
Should adopting an informal approach to resolving a grievance prove unsuccessful, or the matter is 
highly sensitive and not appropriate for an informal process, the following steps give guidance for 
managing a formal grievance:  
 
a) Notification - (making a complaint)  
You must  notify, in writing or otherwise, the substance of the grievance and attempt to 
resolve it with your immediate Manager . 
 
The CEO  may become involved depending on the situation.  
 
If the grievance is of a nature that you cannot notify your immediate Manager  
because it is not appropriate, you may notify the next reporting level up.  
 
For particularly difficult or sensitive grievances, where referral up to the next level is 
neither the appropriate or preferred avenue, you may refer the matter, in writing to, 
direct to the CEO. 
b) Investigation and reporting  
The grievance is investigate d. Relevant material and information are sought, including 
information from other sources where appropriate.  
 
Documentation is complied. the length and formality of communication about the 
grievance will depend on the seriousness and complexity of the comp laint, but should 
generally at this stage be minimal. Communication to those involved, should include

  suggested actions/options to resolve the grievance or to provide guidance for referring 
the matter to the next level up or to the CEO as appropriate.  
All investigation and disciplinary processes conducted at HHC will be managed in  
accordance with the relevant Award and/or legislation, and principles of natural 
justice. If an employee or volunteer is required to respond to allegations again st them 
as part of the investigation process, or respond to concerns raised as part of a 
disciplinary process, the following requirements will apply:  
 
The employee or volunteer  will be provided with an opportunity to respond to any 
allegations or concern s regarding their behaviour, including adequate notice to 
prepare their response which will be a minimum of 24 hours’ notice following written 
notification of an interview/disciplinary meeting.  
 
The employee or volunteer will be provided an opportunity to  have an appropriate 
support person present at any interview/ disciplinary meeting. Please note that 
colleagues will not be considered an appropriate support person if they are a witness 
or otherwise involved in the investigation/disciplinary process.  
 
A written record will be made of formal investigation interviews and disciplinary 
meetings, and a copy will be made available to the employee as soon as practicable 
after the meeting.  
c) Action and record any outcome  
Solution available - A proposed solution is provided to you. If acceptable, it is 
implemented. If the solution affects other employees  or volunteers , it must be notified 
to and agreed with them in advance.  
 
Solution not Immediately available - You and your Manager are to confer with a  
more Senior Manager.  
 
If the matter is still not resolved - If the matter is still not resolved, you may refer the 
matter for consideration of and resolution by the CEO. This may involve a meeting with 
you, your Manager (if appropriate) and the CEO, if in HHC  opinion such a meeting 
would assist a resolution.  
 
If the matter is still not resolved - Either you or HHC  can go to the Fair Work  
Commission or if agreed to another third party for conciliation.  
 
Work must continue - Work must continue in the manner required while the grievance 
is being dealt with. The fact that work continues does not prejudice you or HHC . 
 
6  Confidentiality  
At all times during the grievance procedure, management and the CEO will maintain confide ntiality 
as far as possible.

confidentiality. This means that they cannot talk to other employees, volunteers or contractors 
about the grievance. A support person m ay be made available if required.

1 | Page BYOD Policy _POL_V01_2209  Policy This policy establishes Hope Holistic Care’s guidelines for employee use of personally owned electronic devices for work-related purposes.  Employees of Hope Holistic Care can use their personal electronic devices for work purposes. Personal electronic devices include personally owned smartphones, tablets, laptops and computers.  The use of personal devices is limited to certain employees and may be limited based on compatibility of technology. Contact the human resource (HR) department for more details.  Procedures Device protocols To ensure the security of Hope Holistic Care information, employees are required to have anti-virus software installed on their personal mobile devices. Their devices must be password-protected and secure. Employees may not use cloud-based apps or backup that allows company-related data to be transferred to unsecure parties. Due to security issues, personal devices may not be synchronized with other devices in employees’ homes. Making any modifications to the device hardware or software beyond authorized and routine installation updates is prohibited unless approved by IT. Employees may not use unsecure Internet sites. All employees should use an alternative ringtone and alert for company-related messages and calls. Personal devices should be turned off or set to silent or vibrate mode during meetings and conferences and in other locations where incoming calls may disrupt normal workflow. Where photos are authorised to be taken for work purposes, they are to be removed as soon as possible after they have been uploaded or submitted to authorised systems or personnel. Restrictions on authorized use Employees whose personal devices have camera, video or recording capability are restricted from using those functions anywhere in the client’s home or office or on company property at any time unless authorized in advance by management. While at work, employees are expected to exercise the same discretion in using their personal devices as is expected for the use of company devices. Hope Holistic Care policies pertaining to harassment, discrimination, retaliation, trade secrets, confidential information and ethics apply to employee use of personal devices for work-related activities. Excessive personal calls, e-mails or text messaging during the workday, regardless of the device used, can interfere with employee productivity and be distracting to others. Employees must handle personal matters on non-work time and ensure that friends and family members are aware of the policy. Exceptions may be made for emergency situations and as approved in advance by management. Managers reserve the right to request employees’ mobile phone bills and use reports for calls and messaging made during working hours to determine if use is excessive. Non-exempt employees may not use their personal devices for work purposes outside of their normal work schedule without authorization in advance from management. This includes reviewing, sending and responding to e-mails or text messages, responding to phone calls, or making phone calls. 
BYOD Policy  
2 | Page BYOD Policy _POL_V01_2209  Employees may not use their personal devices for work purposes during periods of unpaid leave without authorization from management. Hope Holistic Care reserves the right to deactivate the company’s application and access on the employee’s personal device during periods of unpaid leave. An employee may not store information from or related to former employment on the company’s application. Family and friends should not use personal devices that are used for company purposes. Privacy/company access No employee using his or her personal device should expect any privacy except that which is governed by law. Hope Holistic Care has the right, at any time, to monitor and preserve any communications that use the Hope Holistic Care’s networks in any way, including data, voice mail, telephone logs, Internet use and network traffic, to determine proper use. Management reserves the right to review or retain personal and company-related data on personal devices or to release the data to government agencies or third parties during an investigation or litigation. Management may review the activity and analyze use patterns and may choose to publicize these data to ensure that Hope Holistic Care’s resources in these areas are being use according to this policy. Furthermore, no employee may knowingly disable any network software or system identified as a monitoring tool. Company stipend Employees authorized to use personal devices under this policy will receive an agreed-on monthly stipend based on the position and estimated use of the device. If an employee obtains or currently has a plan that exceeds the monthly stipend, Hope Holistic Care will not be liable for the cost difference. Safety Employees are expected to follow applicable local, state and federal laws and regulations regarding the use of electronic devices at all times. Employees whose job responsibilities include regular or occasional driving are expected to refrain from using their personal devices while driving. Regardless of the circumstances, including slow or stopped traffic, employees are required to pull off to the side of the road and safely stop the vehicle before placing or accepting a call or texting. Special care should be taken in situations involving traffic, inclement weather or unfamiliar areas. Employees who are charged with traffic violations resulting from the use of their personal devices while driving will be solely responsible for all liabilities that result from such actions. Employees who work in hazardous areas must refrain from using personal devices while at work in those areas, as such use can potentially be a major safety hazard. Lost, stolen, hacked or damaged equipment Employees are expected to protect personal devices used for work-related purposes from loss, damage or theft. Hope Holistic Care will not be responsible for loss or damage of personal applications or data resulting from the use of company applications. Employees must immediately notify management in the event their personal device is lost, stolen or damaged. If IT is unable to repair the device, the employee will be responsible for the cost of replacement. Employees may receive disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment for damage to personal devices caused wilfully by the employee.

Incident Management Policy  
1 | Page Incident Management Policy _POL_V01_2203  Policy HHC’s incident management system is consumer-centred, and focuses on the health, safety, wellbeing, and quality of life of consumers and anyone affected by an incident. Following an incident, HHC’s investigation and resolution processes are outcomes-focused and conducted in line with the principles of Open Disclosure. HHC is committed to ensuring that all incidents and near misses which occur in relation to the provision of services are managed consistently and effectively, and that workers can identify, manage, report and resolve incidents. The organisation collects and reviews data on incidents in order to inform improvement activities. HHC regularly reviews its incident management system and processes to ensure that they are: Well documented; Readily accessible to all workers employed or engaged by the organisation; Reflective and adaptive, with an intent to prevent incidents; and Compliant with the Serious Incident Response Scheme. Definitions Commission refers to the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission Incidents are acts, omissions, events or circumstances that occur or could occur during or in relation to the provision of care and services, or the alteration or withdrawal of care and services, that cause harm, either physically or emotionally, to a worker, consumer, or other stakeholder. Incidents also include acts, omissions, events or circumstances that have caused or could cause damage to property, the environment, material or cause public alarm. Reportable incidents are alleged, suspected or actual incidents which have occurred in connection with service delivery, where the person affected by the incident is a consumer, of severity that must be reported to the Commission. This includes but is not limited to: • Unexpected death; • Unexplained absence; • Unreasonable use of force; • Psychological or emotional abuse; • Neglect; • Unlawful or inappropriate sexual contact; • Stealing or financial coercion by a staff member; and • Inappropriate physical or chemical restraint. Priority 1 incidents are Reportable Incidents of a higher level of harm than Priority 2 incidents and must be reported to the Commission within a more immediate timeframe. Priority 1 incidents include: • Physical or psychological injury or illness requiring onsite medical or psychological treatment to resolve; • Incidents where there are reasonable grounds to report the incident to police; or 
Incident Management Policy  
2 | Page Incident Management Policy _POL_V01_2203  • A consumer’s unexpected death or a consumer’s unexplained absence from the service. All ‘Priority 1’ incidents must be reported to the Commission within 24 hours. Priority 2 incidents are Reportable Incidents which are not Priority 1 incidents, and which result in a lower level of harm to a consumer, which must be reported to the Commission within 30 days of the incident occurring.  All ‘Priority 2’ incidents must be reported to the Commission within 30 days. Workers are staff, contractors and volunteers employed or engaged by HHC  Procedures Induction and staff training All workers must be familiar with the organisation’s incident management system, understand the organisation’s definition of Reportable Incidents, Priority 1 and Priority 2 incidents, and understand the procedures they must follow for reporting all incidents to the organisation and the Commission (if required).  HHC promotes a culture of open reporting and ensures that all workers understand that they are supported to report any incident or alleged incident, and that there will be no negative consequences for doing so. Incident identification If a worker observes an incident, or a consumer or member of the public notifies a worker about an incident that does or could cause permanent or temporary detriment to a consumer, worker or other stakeholder, then the worker must report the incident to the Home Care Manager.  Workers and consumers will be protected against any adverse actions as a result of reporting or alleging that an incident has occurred. Immediate response, and risk mitigation Where possible, an incident will first be addressed by the organisation’s personnel responsible and qualified to effectively manage the incident as it takes place. First responders understand that they must contact emergency services if the situation warrants. The principle is reduce harm, reduce risks and provide support. • Reduce harm as much as possible (First aid) • Reduce risks e.g. consider providing paid leave to distressed workers • Provide support to those affected. Notification procedures Staff must report incidents to various agencies and persons based on the following priority system: • For incidents of a serious nature workers must first contact emergency services. • Workers must report all incidents and near misses internally to the Home Care Manager • If it is determined that the incident is a Reportable Incident, the Home Care Manager is responsible for notifying families, guardians and advocates of the consumer.  
Incident Management Policy  
3 | Page Incident Management Policy _POL_V01_2203  • If an incident is a Reportable Incident, the Home Care Manager will determine whether it is a Priority 1 or Priority 2 incident (with the help of the Commission’s Decision Support Tool), and notify the Commission within the expected timeframe of the Commission. Reporting will be done through the My Aged Care Provider Portal. External Reporting 1) Police If HHC becomes aware of a Reportable Incident of a serious nature, it will be reported to police. This includes in cases: • In which a Reportable Incident is only suspected or alleged to have occurred; • Where there are reasonable grounds to notify police; or • Where the Reportable Incident is criminal in nature.  HHC will notify the consumer and/or their representative if an incident has been reported to the police. 2) Commission - Timeframes Unexplained absence from care will first be reported to the police, then to the Commission as soon as possible, and not later than 24 hours after the absence was reported to the police. All Priority 1 incidents will be reported, at a minimum, to the Commission in a two-stage process: • Within 24 hours: incident notification to the Commission and reporting to police where necessary; and • Within 5 business days: incident status report. All Priority 2 incidents will be reported to the Commission within 30 days of HHC either suspecting or becoming aware of the actual incident. HHC will respond promptly to any further questions from the Commission, and provide a final report if required by the Commission. If required by the Commission, a final report will be provided within 84 business days. The final report will include findings from investigative processes, as well as any additional details required by the Commission. If significant new information comes to light in relation to a Reportable Incident which has already been reported to the Commission, the Home Care Manager is responsible for informing the Commission as soon as possible, using the Commission-approved form.  3) Consider other Legislated/Mandatory Reporting requirements • Practitioner Conduct: These may include legislated ‘mandatory reporting’ to AHPRA if there is concern about conduct regarding registered practitioners (see AHPRA guidance). NB consideration should be given for voluntary reports based on the nature of the incident to allow AHPRA to investigate. • Privacy/Confidentiality: o Consider if this represents a ‘Notifiable Data Breach’ for organisations where turnover >$3million. o For more information see ‘ • Mandatory notifications for Workplace Injury include: o The death of a person o a ‘serious injury or illness’, or 
Incident Management Policy

Supporting consumers Throughout the incident management process, from initial response through to review, consumers and others affected by an incident will be supported by the organisation through means of: • Open Disclosure. The principles of incident management include where safe and appropriate to as much as possible advisie the consumer, following the principles of Open Disclosure.  The Clinical Excellence Commission, NSW, STARS framework (attached) is often useful. • Reassurance  • Trauma and counselling services where required; • Changes to regular care and services if necessary; • Consistent engagement with consumers and others affected by an incident, in line with the principles of open disclosure; and • Clear, ongoing communication regarding the progress and outcomes of the investigation. Consumers and others affected by an incident will be involved in the management and resolution of the incident where appropriate. Consumers and other stakeholders will be informed of HHC’s incident management system, and will have access to this policy. Assessment and investigation The Home Care Manager is responsible for creating an initial assessment of any incident, to determine the severity of an incident and to establish the need for, and scope of, an investigation. If an incident is a Reportable Incident, an internal investigation will take place. All investigations will be undertaken and conducted in accordance with principles of natural justice and procedural fairness. Incidents involving criminal allegations will be reported to law enforcement, who will receive full support of the organisation in their investigations. Whenever an investigation into an incident is conducted, it should establish: • The cause of the incident; • The effect of the incident; • Any organisational processes that contributed to or did not function in preventing the incident; • Changes the organisation can make to prevent further incidents from occurring; • What, if any, remedial action must be undertaken to prevent or minimise future incidents; and • The effectiveness of HHC ‘s incident management system in relation to the incident. Information related to incident investigations, including records of phone conversations, emails, documents and, where possible, records of face-to-face interviews will be recorded and kept in strict confidence.

Grievance Management Policy_POL_V01_2 201 
 1  Purpose  
The purpose of this document is to clearly state Hope Holistic Care Ltd’s (HHC)  approach to the 
handling of grievances in the workplace so that legitimate workplace grievances are addressed in an 
appropriate, confidential, respectful, timely and consistent manner.  
 
2  Scope  
This policy applies to all employees and volunteers of HHC  and covers grievances which arise from  
any work activity, work related social activity and/or any work that an employee or volunteer 
performs on behalf of HHC  outside the workplace, including the attendance at conferences and 
training.  
 
This policy does n ot apply to grievances raised under the provisions of any applicable industrial 
instrument.  
 
3  Definition  
A grievance is an unfair or unjust act or a wrongdoing that causes distress or notable discomfort to 
an employee  or volunteer  at work or within the work environment.  
 
4  Policy  
HHC  aims to foster good working relationships amongst employees and volunteers, however  
acknowledges that from time to time, problems arise at work that may cause employees, or 
volunteers to feel aggrieved.   
 
It is HHC’s  policy that all investigation and disciplinary processes conducted at HHC will be  
managed in accordance with the relevant Award and/or legislation, and principles of  
natural justice.  
 
If an employee  or volunteer  is required to respond to a llegations against them as part of the 
investigation process, or respond to concerns raised as part of a disciplinary process, the following 
will apply:  
-  The employee  or volunteer  will be provided with an opportunity to respond to any 
allegations or conce rns regarding their behaviour, including adequate notice to prepare their 
response, i.e. a minimum of 24 hours’ notice following written notification of an 
interview/disciplinary meeting.  
 
-  The employee  or volunteer  will be provided an opportunity to have an appropriate support 
person  present at any interview / disciplinary meeting. Please note: colleagues will not be 
considered an appropriate support person if they are a witness or otherwise involved in the 
investigation / disciplinary process.  
 
- A written record will be made of formal investigation interviews and disciplinary meetings 
with a copy  being made available to the employee  or volunteer  as soon as practicable after 
the meeting.  
HHC ’s policy is to encourage employees  and volunteers  to work towards resolving grievances by first 
discussing the issue with the relevant person / people. Where this fails to resolve the issue (or where 
the employee or volunteer has concerns about approaching the person / people directly), the 
employee or volunteer should refer to the Grievance Management Procedure which may lead to an 
investigation that will be conducted  by an unbiased person who has experience and knowledge in 
dealing with grievance matters. Any investigation will be conducted in a fair, o bjective and timely 
manner with all relevant parties being informed of the investigation.  
Grievance  Management Policy

Grievance Management Policy_POL_V01_2 201 
 5  Impartiality  
The investigator responsible for handling the complaint is required to remain impartial during the  
process. This means are not to take sides, favour one party, or make presuppositions about the 
matter in the absence of the grievance being investigated.  
 
If the person handling the complaint considers they cannot remain impartial (for example, they are 
friends with one of the parties) they are to refer the complaint to the CEO . 
 
6  Record Keeping and Confidentiality  
All records of any reported grievance and  associated investigation, including any record as it relates 
to an issued warning as a result of the grievance is retained by the CEO.   
 
At all times during the grievance procedure, management and the CEO  will maintain confidentiality 
as far as possible.  
 
Employees, and volunteers involved in the grievance, are required to maintain confidentiality. This 
means they are not permitted to talk to other employees or other volunteers about the grievance.  
 
7  False Complaints  
If it is found that the complaint i s vexatious, malicious or fabricated in any way, appropriate 
disciplinary action or counselling will be considered.
